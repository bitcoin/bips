==Abstract==

This BIP describes a standardized mapping between a special wordlist 
and unique pairs of emoji characters to enable mnemonic phrases to be represented 
in a universally recognizable, language agnostic form, while remaining compatible 
with existing deterministic wallet standards.

This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence --
a group of easy to remember emojisets -- for the generation of deterministic wallets.

Today emoji characters are globally recognized symbols with strong visual memorability.

5. Imprinting a unique, everlasting, dataset into the universal lexicon.
