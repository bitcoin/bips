## Abstract

This BIP defines the rules for validating blocks and transactions using the
Utreexo accumulator. It is important to note that this BIP does not define the
Utreexo accumulator itself, for that see [Utreexo Accumulator Specification](bip-0181.md). This document is only concerned with
the general rules for validating blocks and transactions using the Utreexo,
so that all Utreexo nodes can stay in consensus with one another.

## Motivation

Although Utreexo in its current form is not proposed as a soft fork, it is essential that
all implementations adhere to a consistent workflow when performing consensus-critical
operations. This BIP defines that workflow, along with the specific rules and their
required ordering.

There are five consensus-critical components when using the Utreexo accumulator to
represent the UTXO set:

 - 1: The serialization format of each UTXO ("leaf data").
 - 2: The hash function used to hash the leaf data.
 - 3: Which transaction outputs are excluded from the accumulator.
 - 4: The order of operations for the additions and deletions in the accumulator.
 - 5: The format of the UTXO proof.

A discrepancy in any of the five components above will result in a divergent
accumulator state, leading to consensus incompatibilities.

## Specification

### Node Hashes

During a node's normal operation, it will need to compute the leaf hash for UTXOs
being added or removed from the accumulator. The leaf hash is a 32-byte hash that
is computed using the SHA-512/256 hash function. See [UTXO Hash Preimages](#utxo-hash-preimages) for the
details on how to compute the leaf hash.

Unless otherwise specified, all fields are in little-endian format.

#### UTXO Hash Preimages

Individual UTXOs are represented as 32-byte hashes in the Utreexo accumulator. To obtain this
hash, you must compute the SHA-512/256 hash of the following data:

| Name               | Type                     | Description                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Utreexo_Tag_V1     | 64-byte array            | The version tag to be prepended to the leafhash. |
| Utreexo_Tag_V1     | 64-byte array            | The version tag to be prepended to the leafhash. |
| BlockHash          | 32-byte array            | The hash of the block in which this tx was confirmed. |
| TXID               | 32-byte array            | The transaction's TXID                    |
| Vout               | 4-byte unsigned integer  | The output index of this UTXO             |
| Header code        | 4-byte unsigned integer  | The block height and iscoinbase. This is a value obtained by left shifting the block height that confirmed this transaction by one bit, and then OR-ing it with 1, only if this transaction is a coinbase. |
| Amount             | 8-byte unsigned integer  | The amount in satoshis for this UTXO      |
| Output script size | varint                   | The output script length in bytes              |
| Output script      | variable byte array      | The output script of the UTXO            |

Each field being defined as follows:

##### Version tag

We use [tagged hashes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki#user-content-Design) for the hashes committed in the accumulator for versioning
purposes. This is added so that if there are changes in the preimage of the
hash, the version tag helps to avoid misinterpretation.

The Utreexo version tag is the SHA512 hash of the string `UtreexoV1`, which is represented as the vector
`[85 116 114 101 101 120 111 86 49]` and hex `0x5574726565786f5631`.  (The resulting 64-byte output is
`5b832db8ca26c25be1c542d6cceddda8c145615cff5c35727fb3462610807e20ae534dc3f64299199931772e03787d18156eb3151e0ed1b3098bdc8445861885`).

##### Blockhash

We commit to the hash of the block which confirms the UTXO. This
is not currently used in the validation code, but could be used at a future
version to increase the work required for collision attacks.
A valid blockhash requires a large amount of work, which would prevent an
attacker from performing a standard cycle-finding collision attack in $2^{n/2}$
operations for an n-bit hash.

This could allow a later or alternate version to use shorter truncated hashes,
saving bandwidth and storage while still keeping Bitcoin's $2^{128}$ security.

##### TXID

The TXID is the transaction ID of the transaction that created this UTXO.

##### VOUT

The output index of the UTXO in the transaction.

##### Header code

This field stores the block height and a boolean for marking that the UTXO was
created by a coinbase transaction. Mostly serves to save space as the coinbase
boolean can be stored in a single bit.

This field is a value obtained by left shifting the block height that
confirmed this transaction by one bit, and then setting the least significant bit to 1 only
if it's part of a coinbase transaction. The code to do that is like so:

```
header_code = block_height
header_code <<= 1
if IsCoinBase {
    header_code |= 1 // only set the bit 0 if it's a coinbase.
}
```

The block height is needed as during transaction validation, it is used during
the check of BIP-0065 CLTV. In current nodes, the block height is stored locally
as a part of the UTXO set. Since Utreexo nodes get this data from peers, we need
to commit to the block height to avoid security vulnerabilities.

The boolean for coinbase outputs is needed as they may not be spent before having 100 confirmations.
This data is also currently stored locally as a part of the UTXO set for current nodes.

##### Amount

This field is added to commit to the value of the UTXO. With current nodes, this
is stored in the UTXO set but since we receive this in the proof from our peers,
we need to commit to this value to avoid malicious peers that may send over the
wrong amount.

##### Output script size

As the output script ("scriptPubKey" in Bitcoin Core and btcd) is a variable length byte array, we prepend it with the
length.

##### Output script

This field is added to commit to the output script of the UTXO. With current
nodes, this is stored in the UTXO set but since we receive this in the proof
from our peers, we need to commit to this value to avoid malicious peers that
may send over the wrong output script.

#### Hash function

The leaf data is hashed with SHA-512/256, which gives us a 32 byte hash.
It was chosen over SHA-256 due to the faster performance on 64 bit systems.

#### Excluded UTXOs from the accumulator

Not all transaction outputs are added to a node's UTXO set. Normal Bitcoin nodes
only form consensus on the set of transactions, not on the UTXO set, so different
nodes can omit different outputs and stay compatible as long as those outputs are
never spent. Utreexo nodes, however, do require explicit consensus on the UTXO set
as all proofs are with respect to the Merkle roots of the entire set.

For this reason, we define which UTXOs are not inserted to the accumulator.  Any
variations here will result in Utreexo nodes with incompatible proofs.

##### Provably unspendable transaction outputs

There are outputs in the Bitcoin network that we can guarantee that they cannot
be spent without a hard-fork of the network. The following output types are not
added to the accumulator:
- Outputs whose output script starts with an OP_RETURN (0x6a)
- Outputs with an output script larger than 10,000 bytes

##### Same block spends

Often, UTXOs are created and spent in the same block. This is allowed by Bitcoin
consensus rules as long as the output being spent is created by a transaction earlier
in the block than the spending transaction.
In Utreexo, nodes inspect blocks and identify which outputs are being created
and destroyed in the same block, and exclude them from the accumulator and proofs.

There's no need to provide proofs for outputs which have been created in the same
block. Adding and then immediately removing the output from the accumulator would be
possible but doesn't serve any purpose - once outputs are spent, their past existence
cannot be proven with the Utreexo accumulator (and SPV proofs already provide that).

For these reasons, outputs which are spent in the same block where they are created
are omitted from the accumulator, and those inputs are omitted from block proofs.

#### Order of operations

The Utreexo accumulator lacks associative properties during addition and the
ordering of which UTXO hash gets added first is consensus critical. For
the modification of the accumulator the steps are as follows:

1. Batch remove the UTXOs that were spent in the block based on the algorithm
   defined in [Utreexo Accumulator Specification](bip-0181.md). Deletions itself are order-independent.
2. Batch add all non-excluded outputs in the order they're included in the
   Bitcoin block. Additions are order-dependent.

The removal and the addition of the hashes follow the algorithms defined in
[Utreexo Accumulator Specification](bip-0181.md).

#### Format of the UTXO proof

The UTXO proof has 2 elements: the accumulator proof and the leaf data. The
leaf data provides the necessary UTXO data for block validation that would be
stored locally for non-Utreexo nodes. Non-Utreexo nodes store this data (under "chainstate/" for Bitcoin Core)
but since utreexo nodes don't this data, it must be provided.

The accompanying accumulator proof proves that the given leaf data are committed
in the accumulator. Without this accumulator proof, the Utreexo nodes would not have
a way to ensure that the given UTXO data exists in the UTXO set. The accumulator proof
and the verification ensures that Utreexo nodes are not fooled into accepting transactions
whose input UTXOs do not exist.

[Accumulator Proof](bip-0181.md#definitions) is defined in BIP-0181, and contains two elements:

1. A vector of positions of the UTXO hashes in the accumulator.
2. A vector of hashes required to hash up to the roots.

For (1), positions are in the order of the leaves that are being proven in
the accumulator. These are all the inputs in the natural blockchain order that
excludes the same block spends.

The UTXO hash preimages follow the same ordering as (1) in the accumulator
proofs. Each of the positions in (1) refer to the UTXO hash preimage in the same
index.

| Field Name          | Data Type           | Byte Size | Description                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Accumulator Proof   | variable byte array | variable  | The Utreexo proof as defined in BIP-0181 |
| UTXO hash preimages | variable byte array | variable  | The UTXO data needed to validate all the transaction in the block |

#### UTXO proof validation

For each block, the UTXO proof must be provided with the bitcoin block for
validation to be possible. Without the UTXO proof, it's not possible to
validate that the inputs being referenced exists in the UTXO set.

The end result of the UTXO proof validation results in the vector of UTXO
hash preimages that are required to perform the rest of the consensus
validation checks. Note that the resulting data from the UTXO proof validation
is the same data that would normally be fetched from the locally stored UTXO
set.

The order of operations for the UTXO proof validation are:

1. Hash the UTXO preimages.
2. Verify that the UTXO preimages exist in the accumulator with the verification
   algorithm specified in BIP-0181.

### BIP-0030

[`BIP-0030`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0030.mediawiki) is an added
consensus check that prevents duplicate TXIDs. This check and the historical violations
of this check affect the consensus validation for Utreexo nodes.

### BIP-0030 and BIP-0034 consensus check

Before `BIP-0030`, the Bitcoin consensus rules allowed for duplicate TXIDs. If two
transactions shared a same TXID, the transaction outputs of the succeeding
transaction would overwrite the previously created UTXOs. It was assumed that
TXIDs were unique but it was trivially easy to create a duplicate transaction that was
exactly the same, resulting in a duplicate `TXID` for coinbase transactions by re-using
the same bitcoin address.

`BIP-0030` check is a consensus check that enforces that newly created transactions
do not have outputs that overwrite an existing UTXO.

`BIP-0034` introduces a rule that requires the block height to be included in the coinbase field
of the coinbase transaction. The main reason for the change was to make
coinbase transactions unique so that the expensive check of going through the
UTXO set wouldn't be needed. However, there were blocks in the past that had
random bytes that could be interpreted as block heights. The lowest implicated block
heights are: 209,921, 490,897, and 1,983,702.

Up until block 209,921 the BIP-0030 checks are performed for non-Utreexo nodes.
Since Utreexo nodes only keep the UTXO set commitment, it's not possible to
perform the `BIP-0030` check. In theory, those blocks can't be reorged, because
of checkpoints, that goes back to block height 295,000 with the block hash
`00000000000000004d9b4ef50f0f9d686fd69db2e03af35a100370c64632a983`. Any chain that
doesn't include this block at height 295,000 isn't valid as removing this check
would be a hard-fork. We note, however, that after version `0.30`, Bitcoin Core
will remove the checkpoints[^1], as they are not needed anymore to prevent attacks
against nodes during Initial Block Download. This is effectively a hard-fork,
that will probably never actually happen, however.

Block 1,983,702 is the first block that Utreexo nodes would be in danger of a
consensus failure due to the inability to perform the BIP-0030 checks if someone were
to reuse coinbase transaction from block 164,384. However, this block will happen in roughly
21 years from now, and some mitigations have been proposed [^2].

### Historical BIP-0030 violations

There were two UTXOs that were overwritten by repeated transactions:
`e3bf3d07d4b0375638d5f1db5255fe07ba2c4cb067cd81b84ee974b6585fb468:0` at block height 91,722
`d5d27987d2a3dfc724e359870c6644b40e497bdc0589a033220fe15429d88599:0` at block height 91,812

Since the leaf hashes that are committed to the Utreexo accumulator commit to
the block hash as well, all the leaf hashes are unique and the two historical
violations do not happen with how the UTXO set is represented with the Utreexo
accumulator. To be consensus compatible with clients that retain only the second
occurrences of these outputs, the leaves representing the corresponding first UTXOs in the Utreexo accumulator
are hardcoded as unspendable.

These two leaf hashes encoded in hex string are:

 1. `84b3af0783b410b4564c5d1f361868559f7cf77cfc65ce2be951210357022fe3`
 2. `bc6b4bf7cebbd33a18d6b0fe1f8ecc7aa5403083c39ee343b985d51fd0295ad8`

(1) represents the UTXO created at block height 91,722 and (2) represents the
UTXO created at block height 91,812.

## Rationale

**Why use the Utreexo accumulator to keep track of UTXOs instead of a key-value database like leveldb?**

There's two main advantages to using the Utreexo accumulator instead of a key-value database like leveldb:

 1. Puts a cap on the UTXO set growth.
 3. Performance gains with the elimination of random reads/writes.

### Puts a cap on the UTXO set growth

The UTXO set is the collection of unspent transaction outputs and is used to verify blocks.
As the amount of Bitcoin users grow, the UTXO set grows with it.

The UTXO set is currently around 10GB in 2025 and with pruning that's all it takes to maintain a full node.
However, as the UTXO set grows, the disk storage requirement will grow along with it and increase the barrier to running a full node.

Currently, the UTXO set size is $O(log(N))$ where $N$ is the number of UTXOs.
By utilizing the Utreexo accumulator, we're able to cap the UTXO set growth at $O(log_2(N))$.

### Performance gains with the elimination of random reads/writes

For block validation, there's 3 main bottlenecks:

 1. The internet speed that determines how fast the block is downloaded.
 2. The disk speed that determines how fast the relevant UTXOs for the block are fetched from the disk.
 3. The CPU speed that determines how fast the signatures will be validated.

During the default Initial Block Download with assumevalid on, the slowest operation is (2).
This is because fetching and storing the UTXOs are random disk reads and writes, the slowest part of a disk operation.

However when a node is utilizing the Utreexo accumulator, nothing needs to be fetched from the disk.
Instead, the random disk reads and writes are replaced with Utreexo verification which are just hash calculations.

## Reference Implementation

[Utreexod](https://github.com/utreexo/utreexod): A full node implementation with Utreexo support, written in Golang.

[Floresta](https://github.com/vinteumorg/floresta): A lightweight Utreexo client, written in Rust.

## Backward Compatibility

Utreexo nodes are fully backwards compatible with current nodes as they will follow the same chain tip as the current nodes.
Similarly, Utreexo nodes will only consider currently valid transactions for mempool acceptance.
