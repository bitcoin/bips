== Introduction ==

=== Abstract ===

This document proposes the introduction of a new output type using signatures based on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).
This approach for adding a post-quantum secure output type does not require a hard fork or block size increase.

=== Motivation ===

The primary threat to Bitcoin from Cryptoanalytically-Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) is their potential to break
the cryptographic assumptions of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which secures Bitcoin's signatures and Taproot
commitments. Specifically, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0301141 Shor's algorithm] enables a CRQC to solve the
Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) exponentially faster than classical methods<ref name="shor">Shor's algorithm is
believed to need 10^8 operations to break a 256-bit elliptic curve public key.</ref>, allowing the derivation of private
keys from public keys—a process referred to as quantum key decryption. Importantly, simply increasing the public key
length (e.g., using a hypothetical secp512k1 curve) would only make deriving the private key twice as hard, offering
insufficient protection. The computational complexity of this attack is further explored in
[https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article/4/1/013801/2835275/The-impact-of-hardware-specifications-on-reaching ''The impact
of hardware specifications on reaching quantum advantage in the fault-tolerant regime''].

This proposal aims to mitigate these risks by introducing a Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash (P2QRH) output type that
relies on post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) signature algorithms. By adopting PQC, Bitcoin can enhance its quantum
resistance without requiring a hard fork or block size increase.

The vulnerability of existing Bitcoin addresses is investigated in
[https://web.archive.org/web/20240715101040/https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/innovatie/artikelen/quantum-computers-
and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html this Deloitte report]. The report estimates that in 2020 approximately 25% of the
Bitcoin supply is held within addresses vulnerable to quantum attack. As of the time of writing, that number is now
closer to 20%. Additionally, cryptographer Pieter Wuille [https://x.com/pwuille/status/1108085284862713856 reasons]
even more might be vulnerable.

Ordinarily, when a transaction is signed, the public key is explicitly stated in the input script. This means that the
public key is exposed on the blockchain when the transaction is spent, making it vulnerable to quantum attack until
it's mined. One way to mitigate this is to submit the transaction directly to a mining pool, bypassing the mempool.
This process is known as an out-of-band transaction or a private mempool. In this case, the mining pool must be trusted
not to reveal the transaction public key to attackers. The problem with this approach is that it requires a trusted
third party, which the P2QRH proposal aims to avoid.

Not having public keys exposed on-chain is an important step for quantum security. Otherwise, funds would need to be
spent to new addresses on a regular basis in order to prevent the possibility of a "long-range CRQC attack" recovering
the key behind high-value addresses. A long-range quantum attack can be considered one performed with chain data, such
as that from a used address or one encoded in a spend script. This is likely to be more common early on, as early
quantum computers must be run for longer in order to overcome errors caused by noise. A "short-range quantum attack"
would be one performed on keys in the mempool, which is seen as much more difficult given the block time, and so it
requires more sophisticated CRQCs.<ref name="short-range">
In the paper
[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08585 How to compute a 256-bit elliptic curve private key with only 50 million Toffoli gates]
the authors estimate that CRQC with 28 million superconducting physical qubits would take 8.3 seconds to calculate a
256-bit key, while a CRQC with 6.9 million physical qubits would take 58 seconds. This implies that a CRQC with 4x as
many qubits would be roughly 7 times faster.
</ref>

As the value being sent increases, so too should the fee in order to commit the transaction to the chain as soon as
possible. Once the transaction is mined, it makes useless the public key revealed by spending a UTXO, so long as it is
never reused.

It is proposed to implement a Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash (P2QRH) address type that relies on a PQC signature
algorithm. This new address type protects transactions submitted to the mempool and helps preserve the free market by
preventing the need for private, out-of-band mempool transactions.

The following table is intended to inform the average Bitcoin user whether their bitcoin is vulnerable to a long-range
quantum attack:

It should be noted that Taproot outputs are vulnerable in that they encode a 32-byte x-only public key, from which a
full public key can be reconstructed.

If a key is recovered by a CRQC it can also be trivially checked to see if any child keys were produced using an
unhardened [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki BIP-32] derivation path.

==== Long Range and Short Range Quantum Attacks ====

Long Range Quantum Attack is an attack in which the public key has been exposed on the blockchain for an extended
period of time, giving an attacker ample opportunity to break the cryptography. This affects:

* P2PK outputs (Satoshi's coins, CPU miners, starts with 04)
* Reused addresses (any type, except P2QRH)
* Taproot addresses (starts with bc1p)
* Unhardened BIP-32 HD wallet keys

Short Range Quantum Attack is an attack that must be executed quickly while a transaction is still in the mempool,
before it gets mined into a block. This affects:

* Any transaction in the mempool (except for P2QRH)
* Unhardened BIP-32 HD wallet keys

Short-range attacks require much larger, more expensive CRQCs since they must be executed within the short window
before a transaction is mined. Long-range attacks can be executed over a longer timeframe since the public key remains
exposed on the blockchain indefinitely.

Should quantum advantage manifest, a convention is proposed in spending the 65-byte P2PK output used by the coinbase
output in Block 1. It is proposed to call the address in Block 1 the
[https://mempool.space/address/0496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f81
41781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858ee Canary address] since it can only be spent from by others (assuming Satoshi's
 continued absence) if secp256k1 is broken. Should the Canary coins move, that will signal that reliance on secp256k1
is presently vulnerable. Without the Canary, or an address like it, there may be some doubt as to whether the coins were
moved with keys belonging to the original owner.

Coinbase outputs to P2PK keys go as far as block 200,000, so there are, at the time of writing, 1,723,848 coins that
are vulnerable from the first epoch at the time of writing in P2PK outputs alone. The majority of these have a
block reward of 50 coins each, and there are roughly 34,000 distinct P2PK scripts that are vulnerable. These coins
can be
considered "Satoshi's Shield." Any addresses with a balance of less than the original block subsidy of 50 coins can be
considered cryptoeconomically incentive incompatible to capture until all of these are mined, and these addresses serve
to provide time to
transition Bitcoin to implement post-quantum security.

It's for the above reason that, for those who wish to be prepared for quantum emergency, it is recommended that no more
than 50 bitcoin are kept under a single, distinct, unused Native SegWit (P2WPKH, "bc1q") address at a time. This is
assuming that the attacker is financially motivated instead of, for example, a nation state looking to break confidence
in Bitcoin. Additionally, this assumes that other vulnerable targets such as central banks have upgraded their
cryptography by this time.

The Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA) 2.0 has a timeline for software and networking equipment to be
upgraded by 2030, with browsers and operating systems fully upgraded by 2033. According to NIST IR 8547, Elliptic Curve
Cryptography is planned to be disallowed within the US federal government after 2035. An exception is made for hybrid
cryptography, which is the use of ECC and post-quantum algorithms together.

Although CRQCs could pose a threat to the signatures used in Bitcoin, a smaller threat is to Bitcoin's hash algorithms.
In particular, while a CRQC could use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover's_algorithm Grover's algorithm] to gain a
quadratic speedup on brute-force attacks on the hash functions used in Bitcoin, a significantly more powerful CRQC is
needed for these attacks to meaningfully impact Bitcoin. For instance, a preimage attack on HASH160 <ref name="hash160">
Used by P2PKH, P2SH, and P2WPKH addresses, though not P2WSH because it uses 256-bit hashes.</ref> using Grover's
algorithm would require at least 10^24 quantum operations. As for Grover's application to mining, see
[https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/a/12847 Sam Jaques’ post on this].

=== Rationale ===

This is the first in a series of BIPs under a QuBit soft fork. A qubit is a fundamental unit of quantum computing, and
the capital B refers to Bitcoin. The name QuBit also rhymes to some extent with SegWit.

It is proposed to use SegWit version 3. This results in addresses that start with bc1r, which could be a useful way to
remember that these are quantum (r)esistant addresses. This is referencing the lookup table under
[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#bech32 BIP-173].

The proposal above also leaves a gap in case it makes sense to use version 2, or bc1z, for implementation of other
address formats such as those that employ Cross Input Signature Aggregation (CISA).

P2QRH is meant to be implemented on top of P2TR, combining the security of classical Schnorr signatures along with
post-quantum cryptography. This is a form of hybrid cryptography such that no regression in security is presented
should a vulnerability exist in one of the signature algorithms used. One key distinction between P2QRH and P2TR
however is that P2QRH will encode a hash of the public key. This is a significant deviation from how Taproot works by
itself, but it is necessary to avoid exposing public keys on-chain where they are vulnerable to attack.

P2QRH uses a 32-byte HASH256 (specifically SHA-256 twice-over) of the public key to reduce the size of new outputs and
also to increase security by not having the public key available on-chain. This hash serves as a minimal cryptographic
commitment to a public key. It goes into the scriptPubKey, which does not receive the witness discount.

Post-quantum public keys are generally larger than those used by ECC, depending on the security level. To promote user
adoption and general user-friendliness, the most secure variant (NIST Level V, 256-bit security) is proposed, despite
the increase in key length and verification time.

Support for FALCON signatures will be introduced first, with the intention of adding SQIsign and other post-quantum
algorithms as they are approved. By way of comparison, FALCON signatures are roughly 4x larger than SQIsign signatures
and 20x larger than Schnorr signatures. FALCON is a more conservative approach to applied lattice cryptography than
SQIsign, and its use has recently been approved by NIST. NIST approval streamlines implementations through establishing
consensus in the scientific and developer community. However, even SQIsign signatures are roughly 5x larger than
Schnorr signatures. This means, to maintain present transaction throughput, an increase in the witness discount will
likely be desired in a QuBit soft fork. That will be specified in a future QuBit BIP.

An increase in the witness discount must not be taken lightly. It must be resistant to applications that might take
advantage of this discount (e.g., storage of arbitrary data as seen with "inscriptions") without a corresponding
increase in economic activity. An increase in the witness discount would not only impact node runners but those with
inscriptions would also have the scarcity of their non-monetary assets affected. The only way to prevent these effects
while also increasing the discount is to have a completely separate witness—a "quantum witness." Because it is meant
only for public keys and signatures, we call this section of the transaction the attestation.

To address the risk of arbitrary data being stored using P2QRH (QuBit) outputs, very specific rules will be applied
to spending from the witness stack in SegWit v3 outputs. A fixed signature size will be necessary for spending the
output, and the output must be spendable to be considered valid within node consensus. A fixed signature size will also
be helpful to disambiguate between signature types without an additional version byte, as SQIsign signatures are
substantially smaller than FALCON signatures. Consequently, the correct signature algorithm can be inferred through
byte length. The public key and signature will be pushed separately to the attestation stack. Multiple signatures can
be included in order to support multisig applications, and also for spending multiple inputs.

Since only valid signatures can be committed to in a SegWit v3 attestation, arbitrary data cannot be added by miners,
as that would affect the consensus of their block. A CRQC operator is economically disincentivized from computing a
spendable public key that matched arbitrary signature data due to the cost of that computation. That is because the
cost of such a computation could prove quite substantial, rather than simply putting the arbitrary data within a
Taproot witness.

Additionally, it should be noted, whether an output with a P2QRH spend script corresponds to a FALCON or SQIsign
signature is not known until the output is spent.

While it might be seen as a maintenance burden for Bitcoin ecosystem devs to go from a single cryptosystem
implementation to four additional distinct PQC cryptosystems—and it most certainly is—the ramifications of a chain
broken through extrinsic factors should provide sufficient motivation. An increase in software maintenance everywhere
signatures are used should be seen as an acceptable compromise for maintained integrity of Bitcoin transfers during a
regime of quantum advantage.

The inclusion of these four cryptosystems: SPHINCS+, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SQIsign have various advocates
within the community due to their varying security assumptions. Hash-based cryptosystems are more conservative,
time-tested, and well-reviewed. Lattice cryptography is relatively new and introduces novel security assumptions to
Bitcoin, but their signatures are smaller and might be considered by some to be an adequate alternative to hash-based
signatures. SQIsign is much smaller; however, it is based on a very novel form of cryptography known as supersingular
elliptic curve quaternion isogeny, and at the time of writing, is not yet approved by NIST or the broader PQC community.

In the distant future, following the implementation of the P2QRH output type in a QuBit soft fork, there will likely
be a need for Pay to Quantum Secure (P2QS) addresses. These will require specialized quantum hardware for signing,
while still [https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-01-19-901/ using public keys that are verifiable via classical
means]. Additional follow-on BIPs will be needed to implement P2QS. However, until specialized quantum cryptography
hardware is widespread, quantum resistant addresses should be an adequate intermediate solution.

== Specification ==

We define the signature scheme and transaction structure as follows.

=== Descriptor Format ===

To integrate P2QRH into existing wallet software and scripts, we introduce a new output descriptor function
<code>qrh()</code>. This function represents a P2QRH output, similar to how <code>wpkh()</code> and <code>tr()</code>
are used for P2WPKH and P2TR outputs, respectively.

The <code>qrh()</code> function takes the HASH256 of the concatenated HASH256 of the quantum-resistant public keys as
its argument. For example:

  qrh(HASH256(HASH256(pubkey1) <nowiki>||</nowiki> HASH256(pubkey2) <nowiki>||</nowiki> ...))

This function allows wallets to manage P2QRH addresses and outputs while accommodating multiple public keys of varying
lengths, such as in multisig schemes, while keeping the public keys hidden until the time of spending.

=== Address Format ===

P2QRH uses SegWit version 3 outputs, resulting in addresses that start with <code>bc1r</code>, following
[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#bech32 BIP-173]. Bech32 encoding maps version 3 to the
prefix <code>r</code>.

Example P2QRH address:

<code>bc1r...</code> (32-byte Bech32m-encoded HASH256 of the HASH256 of the public keys)

=== ScriptPubKey ===

The <code>scriptPubKey</code> for a P2QRH output is:

  OP_PUSHNUM_3 OP_PUSHBYTES_32 <nowiki><hash></nowiki>

Where:

* <code>OP_PUSHNUM_3</code> (<code>0x03</code>) indicates SegWit version 3.
* <nowiki><hash></nowiki> is the 32-byte HASH256 of the concatenated HASH256 of each public key.

==== Hash Computation ====

The hash is computed as a merkle tree of public key hashes:

1. For each public key, compute its HASH256
2. Pair the hashes and compute HASH256 of their concatenation
3. Continue pairing and hashing until reaching a single root hash
4. The final hash is the merkle root

For example with 4 public keys:

  h1 = HASH256(pubkey1)
  h2 = HASH256(pubkey2)
  h3 = HASH256(pubkey3)
  h4 = HASH256(pubkey4)

  h12 = HASH256(h1 <nowiki>||</nowiki> h2)
  h34 = HASH256(h3 <nowiki>||</nowiki> h4)

  root = HASH256(h12 <nowiki>||</nowiki> h34)

When spending, if a public key hash is provided in the attestation with an empty signature, that hash will be used
directly in the merkle tree computation rather than hashing the full public key. This allows excluding unused public
keys from the transaction while still proving they were part of the original commitment.

This merkle tree construction creates an efficient cryptographic commitment to multiple public keys while enabling
selective disclosure.

This allows for inclusion of a Taproot MAST merkle root in the attestation, which makes P2QRH a quantum-resistant
version of Taproot.

=== Transaction Serialization ===

Following BIP-141, a new transaction serialization format is introduced to include an attestation field after the witness field:

  [nVersion][marker][flag][txins][txouts][witness][attestation][nLockTime]

* <code>marker</code>: <code>0x00</code> (same as SegWit)

* <code>flag</code>: <code>0x02</code> (indicates the presence of both witness and attestation data)

* <code>attestation</code>: Contains the quantum-resistant public keys and signatures.

=== Attestation Structure ===

The attestation field consists of:

* <code>num_pubkeys</code>: The number of public keys
([https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/general/compact-size/ compact size]).

For each public key:

* <code>pubkey_length</code>: compact size length of the public key.
* <code>pubkey</code>: The public key bytes.

Then:

* <code>num_signatures</code>: The number of signatures (compact size).

For each signature:

* <code>signature_length</code>: compact size length of the signature.
* <code>signature</code>: The signature bytes.

This structure repeats for each input, in order, for flexibility in supporting multisig schemes and various
quantum-resistant algorithms.

For each input, a separate attestation field is used. To know how many attestation fields are present, implementations
must count the number of inputs present in the transaction.

=== Signature Algorithm Identification ===

The specific quantum-resistant signature algorithm used is inferred from the length of the public key.
Implementations must recognize the supported algorithms and validate accordingly.

Supported PQC algorithms and their NIST Level V parameters:

* '''SPHINCS+-256f:'''
  * Public Key Length: 64 bytes
  * Signature Length: 49,856 bytes
* '''CRYSTALS-Dilithium Level 5:'''
  * Public Key Length: 2,592 bytes
  * Signature Length: 4,595 bytes
* '''FALCON-1024:'''
  * Public Key Length: 1,793 bytes
  * Signature Length: 1,280 bytes
* '''SQIsign NIST-V:'''
  * Public Key Length: 128 bytes
  * Signature Length: 335 bytes

Implementations must reject public keys and signatures that do not match expected lengths for supported algorithms.

=== Script Validation ===

To spend a P2QRH output, the following conditions must be met:

1. The <code>scriptPubKey</code> must be of the form:

OP_PUSHNUM_3 <32-byte hash>

2. The attestation must include:

* The quantum-resistant public key(s) whose HASH256 concatenated and hashed again matches the <nowiki><hash></nowiki> in
the <code>scriptPubKey</code>.

* Valid signatures corresponding to the public key(s) and the transaction data.

3. For multi-signature schemes, all required public keys and signatures must be provided for that input within the
attestation. Public keys that are not needed can be excluded by including their hash in the attestation accompanied
with an empty signature. This includes classical Schnorr signatures.

==== Sighash Calculation ====

The sighash for P2QRH outputs follows the same procedure as defined in BIP-0143 for SegWit transactions:

* '''Hash Prevouts:''' Computed over the previous outputs being spent.
* '''Hash Sequence:''' Computed over the sequence fields.
* '''Hash Outputs:''' Computed over the outputs of the transaction.

The message to be signed includes these hashes, ensuring transaction malleability is prevented.

==== Signature Verification ====

Signature verification is as follows:

1. Extract the <nowiki><hash></nowiki> from the <code>scriptPubKey</code>.

2. For each input:

* Compute <code>hashed_pubkeys</code> as specified in the Hash Computation section.

* Compare the resulting hash to <nowiki><hash></nowiki>. If they do not match, the script fails.

3. Verify each signature against the corresponding public key and the sighash.

4. Ensure that the signature algorithm used matches the expected lengths for NIST Level V security, and is supported by
the implementation.

==== Attestation Parsing Example ====

Signing for a single input using both FALCON-1024 and secp256k1 Schnorr:

Number of public keys:

  [num_pubkeys]: 0x02

Pubkey 1:
  [pubkey_length]: 0x0701 (1793 bytes)
  [pubkey]: public_key_falcon_1024

Pubkey 2:
  [pubkey_length]: 0x20 (32 bytes)
  [pubkey]: public_key_secp256k1

Number of signatures:

  [num_signatures]: 0x02

Signature 1:
  [signature_length]: 0x0500 (1280 bytes)
  [signature]: signature_falcon_1024

Signature 2:
  [signature_length]: 0x40 (64 bytes)
  [signature]: signature_secp256k1

Note: This contrasts with multisig inputs, where the attestation structure repeats for each public key and signature.

=== Compatibility with BIP-141 ===

By adhering to the SegWit transaction structure and versioning, P2QRH outputs are compatible with existing transaction
processing rules. Nodes that do not recognize SegWit version 3 will treat these outputs as anyone-can-spend but, per
BIP-141, will not relay or mine such transactions.

=== Usage Considerations ===

==== Transaction Size and Fees ====

Quantum-resistant signatures are significantly larger than traditional signatures, increasing transaction size and the
fees required. Users and wallet developers should be aware of this and plan accordingly.

For example, for CRYSTALS-Dilithium Level V, a single signature is 4,595 bytes, a substantial increase over current
ECDSA or Schnorr signatures.

==== Performance Impact ====

Verification of quantum-resistant signatures will be computationally more intensive, and any attestation discount will
also increase storage requirements. Node operators should consider the potential impact on resource usage in the long
term. Developers may need to optimize signature verification implementations, especially by implementing caching for
key generation.

==== Algorithm Selection ====

Introducing four quantum-resistant algorithms to the Bitcoin ecosystem provides users with the option to select an
appropriate algorithm for their use case, generally based on the amount of value they wish to secure. Developers can
choose to implement support for multiple algorithms in wallets and on nodes to offer quantum-resistant options.

==== Backward Compatibility ====

Older wallets and nodes that have not been made compatible with SegWit version 3 and P2QRH will not recognize these
outputs. Users should ensure they are using updated wallets and nodes to use P2QRH addresses and validate transactions
using P2QRH outputs.

As shown, supersingular elliptic curve quaternion isogeny signature algorithms represent the state of the art in
post-quantum cryptography, beyond lattice cryptography alone, especially when key and signature length are major
constraints. This makes inclusion of SQIsign attractive, and support is planned, but it will be some time until it is
approved for production use. Meanwhile, SPHINCS+ and CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures are already approved and have
achieved broader community consensus. FALCON signatures are also NIST approved.

In comparison, the size of currently used signature algorithms are:

* ECDSA: 70-72 bytes
* Schnorr: 64 bytes

In comparison to inception date, secp256k1 [https://www.secg.org/SEC1-Ver-1.0.pdf was originally specified in 2000].

One consideration for choosing an algorithm is its maturity. secp256k1 was already 8 years old by the time it was
chosen as Bitcoin's curve. Isogeny cryptography when it was first introduced was broken over a weekend.

Ideally SQIsign also proves to be flexible enough to support
[https://www.pierrickdartois.fr/homepage/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Report_OSIDH_DARTOIS.pdf Isogeny Diffie-Hellman] to
replace ECDH applications, and also provide methods for the key tweaking necessary to support TapScript for P2QR
outputs. Additionally, isogeny-based post-quantum cryptography is based on higher-order elliptic curves, and so it
might be possible to implement Isogeny Schnorr signatures.

Signature verification speed as it compares to Schnorr or ECDSA isn't seen as high a consideration as signature size
due to block space being the primary fee constraint. As a P2QRH implementation materializes, a benchmark will be added
for performance comparison. Fortunately, SQIsign signatures are substantially faster to verify than it is to generate
keys or to sign, which is a major consideration when a transaction need only be signed once, or a handful of times with
PSBT, compared to being verified simultaneously on tens of thousands of nodes. Key generation may need to be cached in
BIP-32 Hierarchical Deterministic wallets.

An additional consideration is security level. Longer signature sizes provide more security. NIST has standardized five
security levels for post-quantum cryptography. NIST security level I provides security equivalent to 128-bit keys, and
security level V provides 256-bit security.

It is worth noting by way of comparison that
[https://ethresear.ch/t/how-to-hard-fork-to-save-most-users-funds-in-a-quantum-emergency/18901 Vitalik Buterin's
proposed solution] in an Ethereum quantum emergency is quite different from the approach in this BIP. His plan involves
a hard fork of the chain, reverting all blocks after a sufficient amount of theft, and using STARKs based on BIP-32
seeds to act as the authoritative secret when signing. These measures are deemed far too heavy-handed for Bitcoin.

This document is inspired by [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki BIP-341], which introduced
the design of the P2TR (Taproot) output type using Schnorr signatures.

Much gratitude to my co-founder, Kyle Crews for proofreading and editing, to David Croisant, who suggested the name
"QuBit", and Guy Swann for pointing out the earlier name for the attestation, "quitness", was imperfect. Thank you as
well to those who took the time to review and contribute, including Jeff Bride, Adam Borcany, Antoine Riard, Pierre-Luc
Dallaire-Demers, Ethan Heilman, Jon Atack, Jameson Lopp, Murchandamus, and Vojtěch Strnad.
