==Abstract==

This BIP proposes to extend the range of numeric operands in Script from -2^<sup>31</sup>+1 to 2^<sup>31</sup>-1, to -2^<sup>63</sup>+1 to 2^<sup>63</sup>-1.
It further expands the result range for arithmetic operations from -2^<sup>63</sup> to 2^<sup>63</sup>-1, to -2^<sup>127</sup> to 2^<sup>127</sup>-1.

All existing opcodes<ref name="numeric-opcodes">[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/223fc24c4ebc8dbaecf59ccd36e49193b58d422b/src/script/interpreter.cpp#L944 List of opcodes interpreting stack elements as numbers: OP_ADD, OP_SUB, OP_BOOLAND, OP_BOOLOR, OP_NUMEQUAL, OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY, OP_NUMNOTEQUAL, OP_LESSTHAN, OP_GREATERTHAN, OP_LESSTHANOREQUAL, OP_GREATERTHANOREQUAL, OP_MIN, OP_MAX, OP_1ADD, OP_1SUB, OP_NEGATE, OP_ABS, OP_NOT, OP_0NOTEQUAL, OP_DEPTH, OP_SIZE, OP_WITHIN, OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY]</ref> 
that interpret stack elements as numbers are upgraded to support 64-bit parameters.

The existing number encoding format<ref>[https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/64-bit-arithmetic-soft-fork/397/6?u=chris_stewart_5 The original Script number encoding: minimal-length little-endian, sign-magnitude format]</ref> 
and arithmetic semantics<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/257fd27e4bb7dfd71e5f9f4dd2db34ff5a7ad957/src/script/script.h#L231 Handling of overflows in Script: CScriptNum stores results as int64, permitting out-of-range values until further arithmetic is performed]</ref> 
from the original Bitcoin implementation are preserved, while enhancing the supported precision.

==Motivation==

Several soft fork proposals require support for at least 51 bits of precision in Script to accurately represent satoshi values.
While it is technically possible<ref>[https://rusty.ozlabs.org/2023/10/22/amounts-in-script.html A proof of concept demonstrating how to circumvent the precision limits in the original Bitcoin protocol]</ref>
to operate on such values within the original Script design, doing so is inefficient and error-prone.

===OP_IN_AMOUNT, OP_OUT_AMOUNT===

OP_IN_AMOUNT, OP_OUT_AMOUNT<ref>[https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/op-inout-amount/549/3 OP_IN_AMOUNT, OP_OUT_AMOUNT]</ref> is proposed as part of the OP_TAPLEAFUPDATEVERIFY<ref>[https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/20210909064138.GA22496@erisian.com.au/ OP_TAPLEAFUPDATEVERIFY]</ref> soft fork.
This opcode pushes two values onto the stack, corresponding to the sum of input values and output values of the transaction being validated.

Because UTXO values may reach up to 51 bits, supporting 64-bit arithmetic operations is necessary to enable correct manipulation of these values.

===OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY===

OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1793 OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY]</ref> enables the creation of UTXOs that commit to dynamic pieces of data.
When spending an OP_CCV output, it is necessary to verify that the UTXO's value is properly allocated among the transaction outputs.

Given that UTXO values may span up to 51 bits, OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY would benefit from 64-bit arithmetic support to perform such verifications.<ref>[https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/op-inout-amount/549/5?u=chris_stewart_5 A case study on how OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY can use 64-bith arithmetic]</ref>

===OP_VAULT===

OP_VAULT<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0345.mediawiki OP_VAULT]</ref> introduces a mechanism to enforce a delay period before designated coins may be spent to arbitrary destinations, except along a predefined "recovery" path.
This opcode requires reading the output’s value from the stack for validation.<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/21/files#diff-a0337ffd7259e8c7c9a7786d6dbd420c80abfa1afdb34ebae3261109d9ae3c19R1377 Where OP_VAULT extends CScriptNum's precision to 7 bytes to correctly interpret the revault amount from the stack]</ref>

Since UTXO values may reach 51 bits, OP_VAULT would also benefit from expanded 64-bit arithmetic.<ref>[https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/op-inout-amount/549/4 A case study on how OP_VAULT can use 64-bit arithmetic.]</ref>

===OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY===

OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV)<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki#user-content-OP_AMOUNTVERIFY BIP119]</ref> is a proposed covenant opcode that enables limited forms of transaction pre-commitment.
A future extension, OP_AMOUNTVERIFY, would allow for verification of the total amount spent, the fee paid, or the amounts assigned to specific outputs.

Given that Bitcoin amounts can occupy up to 51 bits, OP_AMOUNTVERIFY and related CTV enhancements would benefit from support for 64-bit arithmetic operations.

==Specification==

All existing opcodes<ref name="numeric-opcodes" /> that interpret stack elements as numbers are modified to support 64-bit operands.
If an operand exceeds the 64-bit range of -2^<sup>63</sup>+1 to 2^<sup>63</sup>-1, the script fails with an error.<ref name="overflow-handling">[https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/overflow-handling-in-script/1549#p-4652-background-3 Overflows propagate an error message `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (unknown error)`]</ref>
The result of the opcode is expanded to accommodate values in the range of -2^<sup>127</sup> to 2^<sup>127</sup>-1.

==Rationale==

===OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY / OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY===

OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY and OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY interpret absolute and relative locktime values based on transaction fields that are limited to 32 bits of precision.
Validation of these values also depends on median-time-past as defined in BIP113.<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki BIP113]</ref>
The maximum allowable median-time-past value on the Bitcoin network is 0xfffffffe.<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32229 This PR explicitly tests the maximum median-time-past limit on the Bitcoin network. The results demonstrate that the maximum median-time-past allowed is 0xfffffffe.]</ref>
Extending the numeric range for these opcodes would not yield additional expressiveness for now - however we could expand the precision of these OP_CLTV/OP_CSV
by using the BIP341's annex.<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki#cite_note-5 What is an annex? The annex is a reserved space for future extensions, such as extending precision of locktime/sequence fields.]</ref>

A benefit expanding these opcodes to accept 8-byte parameters is the quality of error reporting.
Instead of Script execution failing with an overflow error<ref name="overflow-handling"/>
the Script would terminate with an error indicating the locktime was not satisfied.

===Larger precision than 64 bits===

BIP342 permits the introduction of new opcodes that bypass the 520-byte push size limitation.<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki Since OP_SUCCESSx precedes the size check for the initial stack and push opcodes, an OP_SUCCESSx-derived opcode requiring stack elements larger than 520 bytes could uplift the limit in a soft fork]</ref>
This mechanism could theoretically allow for arbitrary-precision numeric operations.
However, the scope of this BIP is intentionally limited to supporting 64-bit operands, sufficient for expressing native Bitcoin amounts.

==Reference Implementation==

A reference implementation is available at:

https://github.com/Christewart/bitcoin/commits/64bit-arith-cscriptnum

==Deployment==

To be determined.

This proposal could be deployed in conjunction with any of the new opcode proposals in the Motivation section using Tapscript's OP_SUCCESSx semantics.<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki#cite_note-1 How a new opcode be used to extend existing opcode precision? OP_SUCCESSx may redefine the behavior of existing opcodes so they could work together with the new opcode. For example, if an OP_SUCCESSx-derived opcode works with 64-bit integers, it may also allow the existing arithmetic opcodes in the same script to do the same.]</ref>

==Backward Compatibility==

As a soft fork, older software will continue to operate without modification.
Non-upgraded nodes, however, will consider all tapscripts that contain an OP_SUCCESSx opcode as ANYONECANSPEND scripts.
They are strongly encouraged to upgrade in order to fully validate the new programs.
