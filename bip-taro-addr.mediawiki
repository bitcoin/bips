==Abstract==

This document describes a way to map a single-asset Taro send to a familiar
<code>bech32</code> address, as well as a way to map that address into a valid
Taro script tree that can be included in a broadcast transaction to complete a
transfer. Once the transaction has been broadcast, the receiver can use the
previous outpoint of the confirmed transaction to lookup the complete asset
proof in their chosen Universe.

==Motivation==

The Taro protocol needs an easy way to allow users to send each other assets
on-chain, without requiring several rounds of interaction to exchange and
validate proofs. By using the existing <code>bech32</code> address
serialization standard, such addresses look distinct, while also looking
familiar enough based on the character set encoding. The described address
format also addresses a number of possible foot guns, by making it impossible
to send the wrong asset (based on an address) amongst other protections.

==Specification==

A Taro asset is uniquely defined by its <code>asset_id</code> as well as the
<code>asset_script_key</code> that serves as a predicate that must be
satisfied for transfers. These values, along with an internal Taproot key used
when creating the Bitcoin output that holds the Taro asset, are encoded into a
single address.

===Encoding an Address===

Let the human readable prefix (as specified by BIP 173) be:

* <code>taro</code> for mainnet
* <code>tarot</code> for testnet

Given the 32-byte <code>asset_id</code>, 32-byte
<code>asset_script_key</code>, and 32-byte x-only BIP 340/341 internal public
key, 8-byte amount to send, an address is encoded as:
* <code>bech32(hrp=taroHrp, asset_id || asset_script_key || internal_key || amt)</code>

===Decoding and Sending To An Address===

Given a valid Taro address, decompose the contents into the referenced
<code>asset_id</code>, <code>asset_script_key</code>, and
<code>internal_key</code>.

Construct a new blank Taro leaf with the following TLV values:
* <code>taro_version</code>: <code>0</code>
* <code>asset_id</code>: <code>asset_id</code>
* <code>asset_type</code>: <code>0</code>
* <code>amt</code>: <code>amt_to_send</code>
* <code>taro_version</code>: <code>0</code>
* <code>asset_script_version</code>: <code>0</code>
* <code>asset_script_key: <code>asset_script_key>

Create a valid tapscript root, using leaf version <code>0x0c</code> with the
sole leaf being the serialized TLV blob specified above.

Create the top-level taproot public key script, as a segwit v1 witness
program, as specified in BIP 341, using the included key as the internal key.

With the target taproot public key script constructed, the asset is sent to the
receiver with the execution of the following steps:
# Construct a valid transaction that spends an input that holds the referenced <code>asset_id</code> and ''at least'' <code>amt</code> units of the asset.
# Create a new Taro output commitment based on the input commitment (this will be the change output), that now only commits to <code>S-A</code> units of <code>asset_id</code>, where <code>S</code> is the input amount, and <code>A</code> is the amount specified in the encoded Taro address.
## This new leaf MUST have a <code>split_commitment</code> specified that commits to the position (keyed by <code>sha256(output_index || asset_id || asset_script_key)</code> within the transaction of the newly created asset leaf for the receiver.
## Add an additional output that sends a de minimis (in practice this MUST be above dust) amount to the top-level taproot public key computed earlier.
## Broadcast and sign the transaction, submitting the resulting Taro state transition proof to a Universe of choice, also known by the receiver.
# Post the resulting state transition proof to the specified Universe. The submitted proof ''must'' contain the optional auxiliary value of the full <code>split_commitment</code> the receiver requires to spend the asset.

===Spending The Received Asset===

In order to spend (or simply confirm receipt) of the received asset, the
receiver should:
# Re-derive the taproot public key script created above that sends to their specified Taro asset leaf.
# Wait for a transaction creating the output to be confirmed in the blockchain.
## In practice this may be via light client protocols such as BIP 157/158, or simply a full node with an address index, or import public key.
# For each previous outpoint referenced in the transaction:
## Look up the previous outpoint as a key into the chosen canonical Universe/Multiverse.
### If the key is found, verify the inclusion proof of the value (as described in [[../master/bip-taro-proof-file.mediawiki|bip-taro-proof-file]]), and extract the <code>split_commitment</code> inclusion proof for the output.
# Walk the Universe tree backwards in time to incrementally construct the full provenance proof needed to spend the asset.
