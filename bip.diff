+`CIPHERTEXT` is the encrypted data resulting encryption of `PAYLOAD` with algorithm
+defined in `TYPE` where `PAYLOAD` is encoded following this format:

+`CONTENT` `PLAINTEXT`
+
+#### Content
+
+`CONTENT` define the type of `PLAINTEXT` being encrypted, it follows this format:
+
+`LENGTH` `VARIANT`
+
+`LENGTH`: 1-byte unsigned integer representing the length of `CONTENT` content.  
+`VARIANT`: there is 3 variants:  
+ - if `LENGTH` == 0, it represent undefined content, there is no `VARIANT`.  
+ - if `LENGTH` == 2, `VARIANT` is 2-byte signed integer (big-endian) representing
+ a BIP number defining the content type.
+ - if 2 < `LENGTH` < 0xFF, `VARIANT` is of length `LENGTH` bytes and the format is
+ let undefined in this specification in order to let room for proprietary usages.
+
+Note: `LENGTH` = 0xFF is reserved for futures extensions.
