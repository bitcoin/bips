==Abstract==

Market depending block size:
If a sender is willing to pay a large fee, then the transaction may be allowed in a block even if blocksize for lower fee-transactions is full. Yet the blocksize is limited harshly by a formula.

==Motivation==

# Keep block space small.
# Waste less with spam transactions.
# Allow larger size when sender pays a lot.
# Allow wallets to calculate/display how much average free block space there is for each fee price.
# Allow senders to be more sure about how the fee/priority of their transaction will behave, especially in the case of increased adoption in the future.

==Specification==

Every transaction has to fit into the following block space:
    Fee must be positive or 0.
    floor( log10( 1.1 + Fee in satoshi per byte of current transaction) * 1024 * 1024 bytes )

==Implementation==

# Sort transactions by fee (in statoshi per byte, lowest first)
# For each transaction starting from lowest fee: Sum up the bytes of space used so far. Check if summed up bytes of space used so far is smaller or equal to formula result.
# If this is valid for each transaction then the blocksize is valid.

==How the formula behaves==

==Backward compatibility==

Soft fork: If only the part smaller 1 MByte would be applied.
Hard fork: If everything would be applied.
