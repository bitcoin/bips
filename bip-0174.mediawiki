==Introduction==

===Abstract===

This document proposes a binary transaction format which contains the information
necessary for a signer to produce signatures for the transaction and holds the
signatures for an input while the input does not have a complete set of signatures.
The signer can be offline as all necessary information will be provided in the
transaction.

===Motivation===

Creating unsigned or partially signed transactions to be passed around to multiple
signers is currently implementation dependent, making it hard for people who use
different wallet software from being able to easily do so. One of the goals of this
document is to create a standard and extensible format that can be used between clients to allow
people to pass around the same transaction to sign and combine their signatures. The
format is also designed to be easily extended for future use which is harder to do
with existing transaction formats.

Signing transactions also requires users to have access to the UTXOs being spent. This transaction
format will allow offline signers such as air-gapped wallets and hardware wallets
to be able to sign transactions without needing direct access to the UTXO set and without
risk of being defrauded.

==Specification==

The Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) format consists of key-value maps.
Each map consists of a sequence of key-value records, terminated by a <tt>0x00</tt> byte <ref>'''Why
is the separator here <tt>0x00</tt> instead of <tt>0xff</tt>?'''
The separator here is used to distinguish between each chunk of data. A separator of 0x00 would mean that
the unserializer can read it as a key length of 0, which would never occur with actual keys. It can thus
be used as a separator and allow for easier unserializer implementation.</ref>.
Each key-value pair must have a unique key within its scope; duplicates are not allowed. The format
of a record is as follows:

Note: <tt><..></tt> indicates that the data is prefixed by a compact size unsigned integer representing
the length of that data. <tt>{..}</tt> indicates the raw data itself.

<pre>
<key>|<value>

The format of each key-value map is as follows:

{key-value pair}|{key-value pair}|...|{0x00}

|}

At the beginning of each key is a compact size unsigned integer representing the type.
This compact size unsigned integer must be minimally encoded, i.e. if the value can be represented using one byte, it must be represented as one byte.
For convenience, this BIP will specify types using their full serialization, so a multi-byte type will have it's full prefix and zero padding as necessary.
There are global types, per-input types, and per-output types.

The currently defined global types are as follows:

* Type: Unsigned Transaction <tt>PSBT_GLOBAL_UNSIGNED_TX = 0x00</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
*** <tt>{0x00}</tt>
** Value: The transaction in network serialization. The scriptSigs and witnesses for each input must be empty. The transaction must be in the old serialization format (without witnesses). A PSBT must have a transaction, otherwise it is invalid.
*** <tt>{transaction}</tt>
** Note: Every PSBT must have a field with this type.

* Type: Extended Public Key <tt>PSBT_GLOBAL_XPUB = 0x01</tt>
** Key: The type followed by the 78 byte serialized extended public key as defined by BIP 32. Extended public keys are those that can be used to derive public keys used in the inputs and outputs of this transaction. It should be the public key at the highest hardened derivation index so that the unhardened child keys used in the transaction can be derived.
*** <tt>{0x01}|{xpub}</tt>
** Value: The master key fingerprint as defined by BIP 32 concatenated with the derivation path of the public key. The derivation path is represented as 32-bit little endian unsigned integer indexes concatenated with each other. The number of 32 bit unsigned integer indexes must match the depth provided in the extended public key.
*** <tt>{master key fingerprint}|{32-bit uint}|...|{32-bit uint}</tt>

* Type: Version Number <tt>PSBT_GLOBAL_VERSION = 0xFB</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
*** <tt>{0xFB}</tt>
** Value: The 32-bit little endian unsigned integer representing the version number of this PSBT. If omitted, the version number is 0.
*** <tt>{32-bit uint}</tt>

* Type: Proprietary Use Type <tt>PSBT_GLOBAL_PROPRIETARY = 0xFC</tt>
** Key: Variable length identifier prefix, followed by a subtype, followed by the key data itself.
*** <tt>{0xFC}|<prefix>|{subtype}|{key data}</tt>
** Value: Any value data as defined by the proprietary type user.
*** <tt><data></tt>

The currently defined per-input types are defined as follows:

* Type: Non-Witness UTXO <tt>PSBT_IN_NON_WITNESS_UTXO = 0x00</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
***<tt>{0x00}</tt>
** Value: The transaction in network serialization format the current input spends from. This should be present for inputs that spend non-segwit outputs and can be present for inputs that spend segwit outputs. An input can have both <tt>PSBT_IN_NON_WITNESS_UTXO</tt> and <tt>PSBT_IN_WITNESS_UTXO</tt>. <ref>'''Why can both UTXO types be provided?''' Many wallets began requiring the full previous transaction (i.e. <tt>PSBT_IN_NON_WITNESS_UTXO</tt>) for segwit inputs when PSBT was already in use. In order to be compatible with software which were expecting <tt>PSBT_IN_WITNESS_UTXO</tt>, both UTXO types must be allowed.</ref>
*** <tt>{transaction}</tt>

* Type: Witness UTXO <tt>PSBT_IN_WITNESS_UTXO = 0x01</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
*** <tt>{0x01}</tt>
** Value: The entire transaction output in network serialization which the current input spends from. This should only be present for inputs which spend segwit outputs, including P2SH embedded ones. An input can have both <tt>PSBT_IN_NON_WITNESS_UTXO</tt> and <tt>PSBT_IN_WITNESS_UTXO</tt>
*** <tt>{serialized transaction output({output value}|<scriptPubKey>)}</tt>

* Type: Partial Signature <tt>PSBT_IN_PARTIAL_SIG = 0x02</tt>
** Key: The public key which corresponds to this signature.
*** <tt>{0x02}|{public key}</tt>
** Value: The signature as would be pushed to the stack from a scriptSig or witness.
*** <tt>{signature}</tt>

* Type: Sighash Type <tt>PSBT_IN_SIGHASH_TYPE = 0x03</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
*** <tt>{0x03}</tt>
** Value: The 32-bit unsigned integer specifying the sighash type to be used for this input. Signatures for this input must use the sighash type, finalizers must fail to finalize inputs which have signatures that do not match the specified sighash type. Signers who cannot produce signatures with the sighash type must not provide a signature.
*** <tt>{sighash type}</tt>

* Type: Redeem Script <tt>PSBT_IN_REDEEM_SCRIPT = 0x04</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.

*** <tt>{redeemScript}</tt>

* Type: Witness Script <tt>PSBT_IN_WITNESS_SCRIPT = 0x05</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.

* Type:  BIP 32 Derivation Path <tt>PSBT_IN_BIP32_DERIVATION = 0x06</tt>
** Key: The public key
*** <tt>{0x06}|{public key}</tt>
** Value: The master key fingerprint as defined by BIP 32 concatenated with the derivation path of the public key. The derivation path is represented as 32 bit unsigned integer indexes concatenated with each other. Public keys are those that will be needed to sign this input.
*** <tt>{master key fingerprint}|{32-bit uint}|...|{32-bit uint}</tt>

* Type: Finalized scriptSig <tt>PSBT_IN_FINAL_SCRIPTSIG = 0x07</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
*** <tt>{0x07}</tt>
** Value: The Finalized scriptSig contains a fully constructed scriptSig with signatures and any other scripts necessary for the input to pass validation.
*** <tt>{scriptSig}</tt>

* Type: Finalized scriptWitness <tt>PSBT_IN_FINAL_SCRIPTWITNESS = 0x08</tt>
** Key: None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
*** <tt>{0x08}</tt>
** Value: The Finalized scriptWitness contains a fully constructed scriptWitness with signatures and any other scripts necessary for the input to pass validation.
*** <tt>{scriptWitness}</tt>

** Key: The resulting hash of the preimage
*** <tt>{0x0c}|{20-byte hash}</tt>

* Type: HASH256 preimage <tt>PSBT_IN_HASH256 = 0x0d</tt>
** Key: The resulting hash of the preimage
*** <tt>{0x0d}|{32-byte hash}</tt>
** Value: The hash preimage, encoded as a byte vector, which must equal the key when run through the `SHA256` algorithm twice

The currently defined per-output <ref>'''Why do we need per-output data?''' Per-output data allows signers
to verify that the outputs are going to the intended recipient. The output data can also be use by signers to
determine which outputs are change outputs and verify that the change is returning to the correct place.</ref> types are defined as follows:

The transaction format is specified as follows:


<pre>
    {0x70736274}|{0xff}|{global key-value map}|{input key-value map}|...|{input key-value map}|{output key-value map}|...|{output key-value map}|

| <tt>0x70736274</tt>
| Magic bytes which are ASCII for psbt. <ref>'''Why use 4 bytes for psbt?''' The
transaction format needed to start with a 5 byte header which uniquely identifies
it. The first bytes were chosen to be the ASCII for psbt because that stands for
Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction. </ref> This integer should be serialized
in most significant byte order.

is part of the 5 byte header for PSBT. This byte is a separator of <tt>0xff</tt> because
this will cause any non-PSBT unserializer to fail to properly unserialize the PSBT
as a normal transaction. Likewise, since the 5 byte header is fixed, no transaction
in the non-PSBT format will be able to be unserialized by a PSBT unserializer.</ref>

|-
| 1+
| Outputs
| Array of key-value maps
| varies
| The key-value pairs for each output as described above. Every output in the unsigned transaction must have a corresponding output map.
|}

Each block of data between separators can be viewed as a scope, and all separators
are required<ref>'''Why are all separators required?''' The separators are required
so that the unserializer knows which input it is unserializing data for.</ref>.
Types can be skipped when they are unnecessary. For example, if an input is a witness
input, then it should not have a Non-Witness UTXO key-value pair.

If the signer encounters key-value pairs that it does not understand, it must
pass those key-value pairs through when re-serializing the transaction.

All keys must have the data that they specify. If any key or value does not match the
specified format for that type, the PSBT must be considered invalid. For example, any
key that has no data except for the type specifier must only have the type specifier in
the key.

===Handling Duplicated Keys===

Keys within each scope should never be duplicated; all keys in the format are unique. PSBTs containing duplicate keys are invalid. However implementors
will still need to handle events where keys are duplicated when combining transactions with duplicated fields. In this event, the software may choose
whichever value it wishes.<ref>'''Why can the values be arbitrarily chosen?''' When there are duplicated keys, the values that can be chosen will either be
valid or invalid. If the values are invalid, a signer would simply produce an invalid signature and the final transaction itself would be invalid. If the
values are valid, then it does not matter which is chosen as either way the transaction is still valid.</ref>

===Proprietary Use Type===

For all global, per-input, and per-output maps, the types <tt>0xFC</tt> is reserved for proprietary use.
The proprietary use type requires keys that follow the type with a variable length string identifer, then a subtype.

The identifier can be any variable length string that software can use to identify whether the particular data in the proprietary type can be used by it.
It can also be the empty string and just be a single <tt>0x00</tt> byte although this is not recommended.

The subtype is defined by the proprietary type user and can mean whatever they want it to mean.
The subtype must also be a compact size unsigned integer in the same form as the normal types.
The key data and value data are defined by the proprietary type user.

The proprietary use types is for private use by individuals and organizations who wish to use PSBT in their processes.
It is useful when there are additional data that they need attached to a PSBT but such data are not useful or available for the general public.
The proprietary use type is not to be used by any public specification and there is no expectation that any publicly available software be able to understand any specific meanings of it and the subtypes.
This type must be used for internal processes only.

==Roles==

Using the transaction format involves many different roles. Multiple roles can be handled by a single entity, but each role is specialized in what it should be capable of doing.

===Creator===

The Creator creates a new PSBT. It must create an unsigned transaction and place it in the PSBT.
The Creator must create empty input fields.

===Updater===

The Updater must only accept a PSBT.
The Updater adds information to the PSBT that it has access to. If it has the UTXO for an input, it should add it to the PSBT.
The Updater should also add redeemScripts, witnessScripts, and BIP 32 derivation paths to the input and output data if it knows them.

A single entity is likely to be both a Creator and Updater.

===Signer===

The Signer must only accept a PSBT.
The Signer must only use the UTXOs provided in the PSBT to produce signatures for inputs.
Before signing a non-witness input, the Signer must verify that the TXID of the non-witness UTXO matches the TXID specified in the unsigned transaction.
Before signing a witness input, the Signer must verify that the witnessScript (if provided) matches the hash specified in the UTXO or the redeemScript, and the redeemScript (if provided) matches the hash in the UTXO.
The Signer may choose to fail to sign a segwit input if a non-witness UTXO is not provided. <ref>'''Why would non-witness UTXOs be provided for segwit inputs?''' The sighash algorithm for Segwit specified in BIP 173 is known to have an issue where an attacker could trick a user to sending Bitcoin to fees if they are able to convince the user to sign a malicious transaction multiple times. This is possible because the amounts in <tt>PSBT_IN_WITNESS_UTXO</tt> of other segwit inputs can be modified without effecting the signature for a particular input. In order to prevent this kind of attack, many wallets are requiring that the full previous transaction (i.e. <tt>PSBT_IN_NON_WITNESS_UTXO</tt>) be provided to ensure that the amounts of other inputs are not being tampered with.</ref>
The Signer should not need any additional data sources, as all necessary information is provided in the PSBT format.
The Signer must only add data to a PSBT.
Any signatures created by the Signer must be added as a "Partial Signature" key-value pair for the respective input it relates to.
If a Signer cannot sign a transaction, it must not add a Partial Signature.

The Signer can additionally compute the addresses and values being sent, and the transaction fee,  optionally showing this data to the user as a confirmation of intent and the consequences of signing the PSBT.

Signers do not need to sign for all possible input types. For example, a signer may choose to only sign Segwit inputs.

A single entity is likely to be both a Signer and an Updater as it can update a PSBT with necessary information prior to signing it.

====Data Signers Check For====

For a Signer to only produce valid signatures for what it expects to sign, it must check that the following conditions are true:

* If a non-witness UTXO is provided, its hash must match the hash specified in the prevout
* If a witness UTXO is provided, no non-witness signature may be created
* If a redeemScript is provided, the scriptPubKey must be for that redeemScript
* If a witnessScript is provided, the scriptPubKey or the redeemScript must be for that witnessScript
* If a sighash type is provided, the signer must check that the sighash is acceptable. If unacceptable, they must fail.
* If a sighash type is not provided, the signer should sign using SIGHASH_ALL, but may use any sighash type they wish.

=====Simple Signer Algorithm=====

A simple signer can use the following algorithm to determine what and how to sign

<pre>
sign_witness(script_code, i):
    for key, sighash_type in psbt.inputs[i].items:
        if sighash_type == None:
            sighash_type = SIGHASH_ALL
        if IsMine(key) and IsAcceptable(sighash_type):
            sign(witness_sighash(script_code, i, input))

sign_non_witness(script_code, i):
    for key, sighash_type in psbt.inputs[i].items:
        if sighash_type == None:
            sighash_type = SIGHASH_ALL
        if IsMine(key) and IsAcceptable(sighash_type):
            sign(non_witness_sighash(script_code, i, input))

for input,i in enumerate(psbt.inputs):
    if non_witness_utxo.exists:
        assert(sha256d(non_witness_utxo) == psbt.tx.input[i].prevout.hash)
        if redeemScript.exists:
            assert(non_witness_utxo.vout[psbt.tx.input[i].prevout.n].scriptPubKey == P2SH(redeemScript))
            sign_non_witness(redeemScript)
        else:
            sign_non_witness(non_witness_utxo.vout[psbt.tx.input[i].prevout.n].scriptPubKey)
    else if witness_utxo.exists:
        if redeemScript.exists:
            assert(witness_utxo.scriptPubKey == P2SH(redeemScript))
            script = redeemScript
        else:
            script = witness_utxo.scriptPubKey
        if IsP2WPKH(script):
            sign_witness(P2PKH(script[2:22]))
        else if IsP2WSH(script):
            assert(script == P2WSH(witnessScript))
            sign_witness(witnessScript)
    else:
        assert False
</pre>

====Change Detection====

Signers may wish to display the inputs and outputs to users for extra verification.
In such displays, signers may wish to identify which outputs are change outputs in order to omit them to avoid additional user confusion.
In order to detect change, a signer can use the BIP 32 derivation paths provided in inputs and outputs as well as the extended public keys provided globally.

For a single key output, a signer can observe whether the master fingerprint for the public key for that output belongs to itself.
If it does, it can then derive the public key at the specified derivation path and check whether that key is the one present in that output.

For outputs involving multiple keys, a signer can first examine the inputs that it is signing.
It should determine the general pattern of the script and internally produce a representation of the policy that the script represents.
Such a policy can include things like how many keys are present, what order they are in, how many signers are necessary, which signers are required, etc.
The signer can then use the BIP 32 derivation paths for each of the pubkeys to find which global extended public key is the one that can derive that particular public key.
To do so, the signer would extract the derivation path to the highest hardened index and use that to lookup the public key with that index and master fingerprint.
The signer would construct this script policy with extended public keys for all of the inputs and outputs.
Change outputs would then be identified as being the outputs which have the same script policy as the inputs that are being signed.

===Combiner===

The Combiner can accept 1 or many PSBTs.
The Combiner must merge them into one PSBT (if possible), or fail.
The resulting PSBT must contain all of the key-value pairs from each of the PSBTs.
The Combiner must remove any duplicate key-value pairs, in accordance with the specification. It can pick arbitrarily when conflicts occur.
A Combiner must not combine two different PSBTs. PSBTs can be uniquely identified by <tt>0x00</tt> global transaction typed key-value pair.
For every type that a Combiner understands, it may refuse to combine PSBTs if it detects that there will be inconsistencies or conflicts for that type in the combined PSBT.

The Combiner does not need to know how to interpret scripts in order to combine PSBTs. It can do so without understanding scripts or the network serialization format.

In general, the result of a Combiner combining two PSBTs from independent participants A and B should be functionally equivalent to a result obtained from processing the original PSBT by A and then B in a sequence.
Or, for participants performing fA(psbt) and fB(psbt): Combine(fA(psbt), fB(psbt)) == fA(fB(psbt)) == fB(fA(psbt))

===Input Finalizer===

The Input Finalizer must only accept a PSBT.
For each input, the Input Finalizer determines if the input has enough data to pass validation. If it does, it must construct the <tt>0x07</tt> Finalized scriptSig and <tt>0x08</tt> Finalized scriptWitness and place them into the input key-value map.
All other data except the UTXO and unknown fields in the input key-value map should be cleared from the PSBT. The UTXO should be kept to allow Transaction Extractors to verify the final network serialized transaction.

===Transaction Extractor===

The Transaction Extractor must only accept a PSBT.
It checks whether all inputs have complete scriptSigs and scriptWitnesses by checking for the presence of <tt>0x07</tt> Finalized scriptSig and <tt>0x08</tt> Finalized scriptWitness typed records. If they do, the Transaction Extractor should construct complete scriptSigs and scriptWitnesses and encode them into network serialized transactions. Otherwise the Extractor must not modify the PSBT.
The Extractor should produce a fully valid, network serialized transaction if all inputs are complete.

The Transaction Extractor does not need to know how to interpret scripts in order to extract the network serialized transaction. However it may be able to in order to validate the network serialized transaction at the same time.

A single entity is likely to be both a Transaction Extractor and an Input Finalizer.

==Encoding==

A PSBT can be represented in two ways: in binary (as a file) or as a Base64 string using the encoding described in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4 RFC4648].

Binary PSBT files should use the <tt>.psbt</tt> file extension.
A MIME type name will be added to this document once one has been registered.

==Extensibility==

The Partially Signed Transaction format can be extended in the future by adding
new types for key-value pairs. Backwards compatibilty will still be maintained as those new
types will be ignored and passed-through by signers which do not know about them.

===Version Numbers===

The Version number field exists only as a safeguard in the event that a backwards incompatible change is introduced to PSBT.
If a parser encounters a version number it does not recognize, it should exit immediately as this indicates that the PSBT will contain types that it does not know about and cannot be ignored.
Current PSBTs are Version 0. Any PSBT that does not have the version field is version 0.
It is not expected that any backwards incompatible change will be introduced to PSBT, so it is not expected that the version field will ever actually be seen.

Updaters and combiners that need to add a version number to a PSBT should use the highest version number required.
For example, if a combiner sees two PSBTs for the same transaction, one with version 0, and the other with version 1, then it should combine them and produce a PSBT with version 1.
If an updater is updating a PSBT and needs to add a field that is only available in version 1, then it should set the PSBT version number to 1 unless a version higher than that is already specified.

==Compatibility==

This transaction format is designed so that it is unable to be properly unserialized
by normal transaction unserializers. Likewise, a normal transaction will not be
able to be unserialized by an unserializer for the PSBT format.
