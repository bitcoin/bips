==Introduction==

===Abstract===

This document proposes a binary transaction format which contains the information
necessary for a signer to produce signatures for the transaction and holds the
signatures for an input while the input does not have a complete set of signatures.
The signer can be offline as all necessary information will be provided in the
transaction.

===Motivation===

Creating unsigned or partially signed transactions to be passed around to multiple
signers is currently implementation dependent, making it hard for people who use
different wallet software from being able to easily do so. One of the goals of this
document is to create a standard and extensible format that can be used between clients to allow
people to pass around the same transaction to sign and combine their signatures. The
format is also designed to be easily extended for future use which is harder to do
with existing transaction formats.

Signing transactions also requires users to have access to the UTXOs being spent. This transaction
format will allow offline signers such as air-gapped wallets and hardware wallets
to be able to sign transactions without needing direct access to the UTXO set and without
risk of being defrauded.

==Specification==

The Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) format consists of key-value maps.
Each key-value pair must be unique within its scope; duplicates are not allowed.
Each map consists of a sequence of records, terminated by a <tt>0x00</tt> byte <ref>'''Why
is the separator here <tt>0x00</tt> instead of <tt>0xff</tt>?'''
The separator here is used to distinguish between each chunk of data. A separator of 0x00 would mean that
the unserializer can read it as a key length of 0, which would never occur with actual keys. It can thus
be used as a separator and allow for easier unserializer implementation.</ref>. The format
of a record is as follows:

Note: <tt><..></tt> indicates that the data is prefixed by a compact size unsigned integer representing
the length of that data. <tt>{..}</tt> indicates the raw data itself.

<pre>
<key>|<value>

The format of each key-value map is as follows:

<pre>
{key-value pair}|{key-value pair}|...|{0x00}

The first byte of each key specifies the type of the key-value pair. Some types are
for global fields and other fields are for each input. The only required type in a
PSBT is the transaction type, as defined below. The currently defined global types are as follows:

!Format Example
|-

| None. The key must only contain the 1 byte type.
| The transaction in network serialization. The scriptSigs and
witnesses for each input must be empty unless the input is complete. The transaction
must be in the witness serialization format as defined in BIP 144. A PSBT must have
a transaction, otherwise it is invalid.

| Redeem Script<ref>'''Why are redeem scripts and witness scripts global''' Redeem
  scripts and witness scripts are global data to avoid duplication. Instead of specifying
  a redeems script and witness script multiple times in inputs that need those scripts,
  they are specified once in the global data.</ref>
| The hash160 of the redeem script
| A redeem script that will be needed to sign a Pay-To-Script-Hash input or is spent
to by an output.<ref>'''Why are outputs' redeem scripts and witness scripts included?'''
Redeem scripts and witness scripts spent to by an output in this transaction are included
so that the user can verify that the transaction they are signing is creating the correct
outputs that have the correct redeem and witness scripts. This is best used when the 
PSBT creator is not trusted by the signers.</ref>

The sighash type is only a recommendation and the signer does not need to use
the sighash type specified.

is optional to allow for completed inputs to be skipped without needing a separator byte.
If one input has this type, then all inputs must have it.

| Magic Bytes
| int32_t
| <tt>0x70736274</tt>
| Magic bytes which are ASCII for psbt. <ref>'''Why use 4 bytes for psbt?''' The
transaction format needed to start with a 5 byte header which uniquely identifies
it. The first bytes were chosen to be the ASCII for psbt because that stands for
Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction. </ref> This integer should be serialized
in most significant byte order.
|-
| 1
| separator
| char
| <tt>0xff</tt>
| Must be <tt>0xff</tt> <ref>'''Why Use a separator after the magic bytes?''' The separator
is part of the 5 byte header for PSBT. This byte is a separator of <tt>0xff</tt> because
this will cause any non-PSBT unserializer to fail to properly unserialize the PSBT
as a normal transaction. Likewise, since the 5 byte header is fixed, no transaction
in the non-PSBT format will be able to be unserialized by a PSBT unserializer.</ref>

| Key-value Map
| varies
| The key-value pairs for all global data.
|-
| 1+
| Inputs
| Array of key-value maps
| varies
| The key-value pairs for each input as described below
|}

Each block of data between separators can be viewed as a scope, and all separators
are required<ref>'''Why are all separators required?''' The separators are required
so that the unserializer knows which input it is unserializing data for.</ref>.
Types can be skipped when they are unnecessary. For example, if an input is a witness
input, then it should not have a Non-Witness UTXO key-value pair.

If the signer encounters key-value pairs that it does not understand, it must
pass those key-value pairs through when re-serializing the transaction.

===Handling Duplicated Keys===

Keys within each scope should never be duplicated; all keys in the format are unique. However implementors
will still need to handle events where keys are duplicated, either duplicated in the transaction
itself or when combining transactions with duplicated fields. If duplicated keys are
encountered, the software may choose to use any of the values corresponding to that key.

==Responsibilities==

Using the transaction format involves many different responsibilities. These responsibilities can be handled by a single entity, but each responsibility is specialized in what it should be capable of doing.

===Creator===

The Creator must be capable of accepting either a network serialized transaction, or a PSBT.
The Creator can either produce a new PSBT, or update the provided PSBT.
For any scriptSigs which are non-final, the Creator will provide an empty scriptSig and input fields with information from the scriptSig, if any.
If possible,  the Creator should also look for any required redeemScripts and witnesScripts and add those to the global data section of the PSBT.
The Creator should also provide any related UTXOs that it knows about.

===Signer===

The Signer must only accept a PSBT.
The Signer must only use the UTXOs provided in the PSBT to produce signatures for inputs.
The Signer should not need require any additional data sources, as all necessary information is provided in the PSBT format.
Any signatures created by the Signer must be added as a "Partial Signature" key-value pair for the respective input it relates to.

The Signer can additionally compute the addresses and values being sent, and the transaction fee,  optionally showing this data to the user as a confirmation of intent and the consequences of signing the PSBT.

===Combiner===

The Combiner can accept 1 or many PSBTs.
The Combiner must merge them into one PSBT (if possible), or fail.
The resulting PSBT must contains all of the key-value pairs from each of the PSBTs.
The Combined must remove any duplicate key-value pairs, in accordance with the specification.

===Finalizer===

The Finalizer must only accept a PSBT.
The Finalizer transforms a PSBT into a network serialized transaction.

For any inputs which are not complete, the Finalizer will emplace an empty scriptSig in the network serialized transaction.
For any input which has a complete set of signatures, the Finalizer must attempt to build the complete scriptSig and encode it into the network serialized transaction.

==Extensibility==

The Partially Signed Transaction format can be extended in the future by adding
new types for key-value pairs. Backwards compatibilty will still be maintained as those new
types will be ignored and passed-through by signers which do not know about them.

Additional key-value maps with different types for the key-value pairs can be added on to
the end of the format. The number of each map that follows must be specified in the globals
section so that parsers will know when to use different definitions of the data types.

==Compatibility==

This transaction format is designed so that it is unable to be properly unserialized
by normal transaction unserializers. Likewise, a normal transaction will not be
able to be unserialized by an unserializer for the PSBT format.
