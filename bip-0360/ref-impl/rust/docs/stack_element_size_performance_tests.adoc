= Stack Element Size Performance Tests

:numbered:

== Overview

BIP-0360 proposes an increase in stack element size from current 520 bytes (v0.29) to 8kb.

Subsequently, there is a need to determine the performance and stability related consequences of doing so.

== Regression Tests

The following regression tests failed with `MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE` set to 8000 .

[cols="1,1,2"]

|feature_taproot.py       | line 1338       | Missing error message 'Push value size limit exceeded' from block response 'mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Stack size must be exactly one after execution)'

|rpc_createmultisig.py    | lines 75-75     | No exception raised: redeemScript exceeds size limit: 684 > 520"
|===

**Analysis**

These 4 tests explicitly test for a stack element size of 520 and are expected to fail with a stack element size of 8Kb.
Subsequently, no further action needed.


== Performance Tests

=== OP_SHA256

The following Bitcoin script is used to conduct this performance test:

-----
<pre-image array> OP_SHA256 OP_DROP OP_1
-----

When executed, this script adds the pre-image array of arbitrary data to the stack.
Immediately after, a SHA256 hash function pops the pre-image array off the stack, executes a hash and adds the result to the top of the stack.
The `OP_DROP` operation removes the hash result from the stack.

|===

**Analysis**

The following observations are made from the performance test:

. **Performance Scaling**: The increase from 520 bytes to 8000 bytes (15.4x size increase) results in approximately 9.8x performance degradation (19,173 ns/op vs 1,947 ns/op).
This represents sub-linear scaling, which suggests the implementation handles large data efficiently.

. **Instruction Count Scaling**: Instructions per operation increase from 27,681 to 285,220 (10.3x increase), closely matching the performance degradation, indicating the bottleneck is primarily computational rather than memory bandwidth.

. **Throughput Impact**: Operations per second decrease from 513,698 op/s to 52,158 op/s, representing a 9.8x reduction in throughput.

. **Cache Efficiency**: The IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) remains relatively stable (6.759 to 7.094), suggesting good CPU pipeline utilization despite the increased data size.

. **Memory Access Patterns**: The branch mis-prediction rate increases slightly (0.0% to 0.4%), indicating minimal impact on branch prediction accuracy.

|===

====== Explanation

Even though 64 bytes doesn't require padding (it's exactly one SHA256 block), the ins/op still increases from 8,736 to 11,107 instructions. Here's why:

. Data Movement Overhead
   
    * 1 byte: Minimal data to copy into the SHA256 processing buffer
    * 64 bytes: 64x more data to move from the witness stack into the SHA256 input buffer
    * Memory copying operations add instructions

. SHA256 State Initialization

    * 1 byte: The 1-byte input gets padded to 64 bytes internally, but the padding is mostly zeros
    * 64 bytes: All 64 bytes are actual data that needs to be processed
    * The SHA256 algorithm may have different code paths for handling "real" data vs padded data

. Memory Access Patterns

    * 1 byte: Single byte access, likely cache-friendly
    * 64 bytes: Sequential access to 64 bytes, potentially different memory access patterns
    * May trigger different CPU optimizations or cache behavior

. Bit Length Processing

    * 1 byte: The SHA256 algorithm needs to set the bit length field (8 bits)
    * 64 bytes: The bit length field is 512 bits
    * Different bit length values may cause different code paths in the SHA256 implementation

. Loop Unrolling and Optimization

    * 1 byte: Compiler might optimize the single-block case differently
    * 64 bytes: May use different loop structures or optimization strategies
    * The SHA256 implementation might have specialized code paths for different input sizes

. Witness Stack Operations

    * 1 byte: Small witness element, minimal stack manipulation
    * 64 bytes: Larger witness element, more complex stack operations
    * The Bitcoin script interpreter has to handle larger data on the stack

The increase from 8,736 to 11,107 instructions (~27% increase) suggests that even without padding overhead, the additional data movement and processing of "real" data vs padded data adds significant instruction count.
This is a good example of how seemingly small changes in input size can affect the underlying implementation's code paths and optimization strategies.

=== OP_DUP OP_SHA256

NOTE:  This test is likely irrelevant as per latest BIP-0360: _To prevent OP_DUP from creating an 8 MB stack by duplicating stack elements larger than 520 bytes we define OP_DUP to fail on stack elements larger than 520 bytes_.

This test builds off the previous (involving the hashing of large stack element data) by duplicating that stack element data.

The following Bitcoin script is used to conduct this performance test:

-----
<pre-image array> OP_DUP OP_SHA256 OP_DROP OP_1
-----

When executed, this script adds the pre-image array of arbitrary data to the stack.
Immediately after, a `OP_DUP` operation duplicates the pre-image array on the stack.
Then, a SHA256 hash function pops the pre-image array off the stack, executes a hash and adds the result to the top of the stack.
The `OP_DROP` operation removes the hash result from the stack.

==== Analysis

The following observations are made from the performance test (in comparison to the `OP_SHA256` test):

. OP_DUP Overhead: The OP_DUP operation adds overhead by duplicating the stack element, which requires:
    * Memory allocation for the duplicate
    * Data copying from the original to the duplicate
    * Additional stack manipulation

. Size-Dependent Impact on ns/op:
    * For small elements (1-100 bytes): Significant overhead (4.4% to 12.2%)
    * For medium elements (520 bytes): Moderate overhead (4.6%)
    * For large elements (8000 bytes): Negligible difference (-0.4%)

. Instruction Count Impact:
    * 8000 bytes: 304,137 → 306,887 instructions (+2,750 instructions)
    * The additional instructions for OP_DUP are relatively small compared to the SHA256 computation

. Memory Operations:
+
The OP_DUP operation primarily affects memory operations rather than computational complexity.
This explains why the impact diminishes with larger data sizes where SHA256 computation dominates the performance.

This analysis shows that the OP_DUP operation has a measurable but manageable performance impact, especially for larger stack elements where the computational overhead of SHA256 dominates the overall execution time.

=== Procedure

* Testing is done using functionality found in the link:https://github.com/jbride/bitcoin/tree/p2qrh[p2qrh branch] of Bitcoin Core.

* Compilation of Bitcoin Core is done using the following `cmake` flags:
+
-----
$ cmake \
    -B build \
    -DWITH_ZMQ=ON \
    -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON \
    -DBUILD_BENCH=ON

$ cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
-----

* Bench tests are conducted similar to the following :
+
-----
$ export PREIMAGE_SIZE_BYTES=8000
$ ./build/bin/bench_bitcoin --filter=VerifySHA256Bench -min-time=5000
-----

== Failure Analysis

Goals:

* Measure stack memory usage to detect overflows or excessive stack growth.
* Monitor heap memory usage to identify increased allocations or leaks caused by larger elements.
* Detect memory errors (e.g., invalid reads/writes, use-after-free) that might arise from modified stack handling.
* Assess performance impacts (e.g., memory allocation overhead) in critical paths like transaction validation.

=== Memory Errors

AddressSanitizer is a fast, compiler-based tool (available in GCC/Clang) for detecting memory errors with lower overhead than Valgrind.

==== Results

No memory errors or leaks were revealed by AddressSanetizer when running the `OP_SHA256` bench test for 30 minutes.

==== Procedure

AddressSanitizer is included with Clang/LLVM

. Compilation of Bitcoin Core is done using the following `cmake` flags:
+
----- 
$ cmake -B build \
    -DWITH_ZMQ=ON \
    -DBUILD_BENCH=ON \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
    -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON \
    -DSANITIZERS=address,undefined

$ cmake --build build -j$(nproc) 
-----

. Check that ASan is statically linked to the _bench_bitcoin_ executable:
+
-----
$ nm build/bin/bench_bitcoin | grep asan | more
0000000000148240 T __asan_address_is_poisoned
00000000000a2fe6 t __asan_check_load_add_16_R13

...

000000000316c828 b _ZZN6__asanL18GlobalsByIndicatorEmE20globals_by_indicator
0000000003170ccc b _ZZN6__asanL7AsanDieEvE9num_calls
-----

. Set the following environment variable:
+
-----
$ export ASAN_OPTIONS="halt_on_error=0:detect_leaks=1:log_path=/tmp/asan_logs/asan"
-----
+
Doing so ensures that _address sanitizer_ :

.. avoids halting on the first error
.. is enable memory leak detection
.. writes ASAN related logs to a specified directory
