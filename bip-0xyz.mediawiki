==Abstract==

Standardize the existing message sign/verify functionality existing in current Bitcoin implementations.

==Motivation==

Reasons to standarize the existing process:
# Ensure that new implementations of sign/verify functions are interoperatable.
# Provide a baseline for extending the sign/verify functions for new address schemes.

==Specification==

The following workflow will discribe the sign / verify functionality

===Sign Message===

# Retrieve the private key of the address that will be used in signing.
# Allocate a message buffer initialized with the line `Bitcoin Signed Message:` in it (`0x426974636f696e205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a`).
# Append the message to be signed to the buffer.
# Perform a SHA256 hash on the buffer.
# Perform a secondary SHA256 hash on the previous hash.
# Perform an ECDSA sign operation on the resultant hash using the previously retrieved key.
# Base64 encode the resultant signature data.

===Verify Message===

# Retrieve the public key of the address that will be used for verification.
# Allocate a message buffer initialized with the line `Bitcoin Signed Message:` in it (`0x426974636f696e205369676e6564204d6573736167653a0a`).
# Append the message to be verified to the buffer.
# Perform a SHA256 hash on the buffer.
# Perform a secondary SHA256 hash on the previous hash.
# Decode the provided Base64 signature data provided.
# Perform an ECDSA verify operation using the previous hash, the retrieved public key and the decoded signature data.

==Backward compatibility==

No compatibility conflicts as this implementation is already standardized among many implementations.

==Implementation==
