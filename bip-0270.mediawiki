  BIP: 270
  Title: Simplified Payment Protocol
  Author: Wallet Workshop
  Created: 2019-02-22
</pre>

==Abstract==

This BIP describes a protocol for communication between a payment host (usually
either a merchant, a payment processor, or simply the recipient's wallet) and
their customer (the sender of the funds), enabling both a better customer
experience, simpler wallet infrastructure, more advanced features such as
multiple outputs, and better security against man-in-the-middle attacks on the
payment process.

This BIP is a simplified update to BIP 70 with a few important differences.
First, we have switched from protobufs (protocol buffers) to JSON. Second, we
have removed the redundant signatures from the messages and define
authentication to happen at the communication later (usually HTTPS). Thirdly, we
add a notion of optional output values and output descriptions. There are a few
other minor differences such as removing the redundant PaymentDetails object and
changing all variable names to camelCase, and changing some names and terms.

TODO: Create a spec for NFC application ID for this. Ask Rafa.

==Motivation==

The naive Bitcoin payment protocol operates as follows:

# Customer adds items to an online shopping basket, and decides to pay using Bitcoin.
# Payment host generates a unique payment address, associates it with the customer's order, and asks the customer to pay.
# Customer copies the Bitcoin address from the payment host's web page and pastes it into whatever wallet they are using OR follows a bitcoin: link and their wallet is launched with the amount to be paid.
# Customer authorizes payment to the payment host's address and broadcasts the transaction through the Bitcoin p2p network.
# Payment host's server detects payment and after sufficient transaction confirmations considers the transaction final.

There are several major problems with the naive approach. First, it assumes the
customer broadcasts the transaction, which requires that the customer connect to
the Bitcoin p2p network and for the payment host to wait for the transaction to
propagate before accepting the payment. Second, it has no ability to allow for
multiple outputs, which is necessary for many interesting use-cases of Bitcoin
such as OP_RETURN data. Thirdly, there is no reliable way for a payment host to
refund a payment in case of an issue.

This BIP extends the naive protocol to simplify wallets, add new features, and make every future interaction on-chain possible:

# Human-readable, secure payment destinations-- customers will be asked to authorize payment to "example.com" instead of an inscrutable, 34-character bitcoin address.
# Secure proof of payment, which the customer can use in case of a dispute with the payment host.
# Resistance from man-in-the-middle attacks that replace a payment host's bitcoin address with an attacker's address before a transaction is authorized with a hardware wallet.
# Payment is sent directly to the payment host, removing the necessity of the customer engaging with the Bitcoin p2p network, and enabling quicker confirmation.
# Payment received messages, so the customer knows immediately that the payment host has received, and has processed (or is processing) their payment.
# Refund addresses, automatically given to the payment host by the customer's wallet software, so payment hosts do not have to contact customers before refunding overpayments or orders that cannot be fulfilled for some reason.
# Payment can contain multiple outputs which can be arbitrary scripts and not just addresses, making new applications possible.
# It is no longer necessary for wallets to connect to the Bitcoin p2p network to broadcast transactions.
# It is no longer necessary for payment hosts to maintain an address index to monitor for in coming transactions.

Please note that the "payment host" in this document may not actually be the
recipient of the funds. Like BitPay, the payment host may actually be a host or
payment processor who is providing this protocol as a service for another party
who is the actual recipient of the funds. We have chosen the name "payment" host
to be an abstraction over either a merchant, a payment processor, a wallet, or
any other agent that receives funds or acts as a proxy to whoever is the true
recipient of the funds.

==Protocol==

This BIP describes payment protocol messages encoded using JSON, authenticated
and communicated using HTTPS or other authentication systems and communication
systems (such as the blockchain itself). Future BIPs might extend this payment
protocol to other encodings, PKI systems, or transport protocols.

The payment protocol consists of three messages; PaymentRequest, Payment,
and PaymentACK, and begins with the customer somehow indicating that
they are ready to pay and the payment host's server responding with a
PaymentRequest message:

<img src=bip-0270/Protocol_Sequence.png></img>

==Messages==

There are several JSON objects used in the protocol. We start with a summary of
the JSON objects, and then proceed to the details.

* Output: A way of specifying a Bitcoin transaction output, including the value and script.
* PaymentDetails: A way of specifying the details of a required payment, including a list of outputs, expiration data, and other meta data.
* PaymentRequest: A payment request includes a payment details object along with room for extensibility (in the original BIP 70 spec, the payment request object was where the signature went, but we have removed that for BIP 270).
* Payment: Includes a signed Bitcoin transaction.

Note that in all cases we try to stay as close as possible to the original BIP
70 spec, but with some important differences due to the fact that we are using
JSON instead of protocol buffers. The two biggest differences are that all
values are represented as numbers and all byte strings are represented as hex
encoded strings. Do NOT prefix the hex encoded strings with "0x".

===Output===

Outputs are used in PaymentRequest messages to specify where a payment (or
part of a payment) should be sent. They are also used in Payment messages
to specify where a refund should be sent.

<pre>
Output {
  amount // number. optional.
  script // string. required. hexadecimal script.
  description // string. optional. must not have JSON string length of greater than 100.
}
</pre>

{|
| amount || Number of satoshis (0.00000001 BTC) to be paid. It is optional in order two allow the two most common flows for payments. In the usual flow, the payment host sets the value and the user must pay the required amount exactly as specified. If the user pays any other amount, the payment is invalid. However, if the payment host leaves the amount unspecified, any other amount is allowed. This would be the case during the second most common flow when a user is sending from one of their own wallets to another and uses the sending wallet to specify the amount. It can also be used for tipping.
|-
| script || A "TxOut" script where payment should be sent, formatted as a hexadecimal string.
|-
| description || An optional description such as "tip" or "sales tax". Maximum length is 50 characters.
|}

===PaymentRequest===

A payment request contains the informtion the consumer needs to make the payment to the payment host.

<pre>
PaymentRequest {
    network // string. required. always set to "bitcoin".
    outputs // an array of outputs. required, but can have zero elements.
    creationTimestamp // number. required.
    expirationTimestamp // number. optional.
    memo // string. optional.
    paymentUrl // string. required.
    merchantData // string. optional.
}
</pre>
{|
| network || This field is required and always set to "bitcoin". If set to any other value besides "bitcoin", no wallet should process the payments. For test purposes, one can set this field to "test" which will ensure that no wallet will accidentally send a payment to what might be invalid or test addresses.
|-
| outputs || One or more outputs where Bitcoins are to be sent. For any outputs with no amount, the user will be asked to specify an amount. This is most useful for self-payments from wallet to wallet or for tipping. For instance, the output may have a description of "tip"
|-
| creationTimestamp || Unix timestamp (seconds since 1-Jan-1970 UTC) when the PaymentRequest was created.
|-
| expirationTimestamp || Unix timestamp (UTC) after which the PaymentRequest should be considered invalid.
|-
| memo || Note that should be displayed to the customer, explaining what this PaymentRequest is for. Maximum length is 50 characters.
|-
| paymentUrl || Secure HTTPS location where a Payment message (see below) will be sent to obtain a PaymentACK. Maximum length is 4000 characters.
|-
| merchantData || Arbitrary data that may be used by the payment host to identify the PaymentRequest. May be omitted if the payment host does not need to associate Payments with PaymentRequest or if they associate each PaymentRequest with a separate payment address. Maximum length is 10000 characters.
|}

The paymentUrl specified in the PaymentRequest should remain valid at least until the PaymentRequest
expirationTimestamp (or as long as possible if the PaymentRequest does not expire). Note that this is irrespective of
any state change in the underlying payment request; for example cancellation of an order should not
invalidate the paymentUrl, as it is important that the payment host's server can record mis-payments
in order to refund the payment.

When a Bitcoin wallet application receives a PaymentRequest, it must authorize payment by doing the following:

# Validate the payment host's identity and signature using the PKI system. The PKI system is assumed to occur in a wrapper layer (such as HTTPS) and if no PKI system is available then the wallet can choose whether or not to display the payment request. The PKI system is usually HTTPS, and as such if the payment request is retrieved over HTTPS then the domain name should be displayed as the payment host.
# Validate that customer's system unix time (UTC) is before PaymentRequest.expirationTimestamp. If it is not, then the payment request must be rejected.
# Display the payment host's identity and ask the customer if they would like to submit payment (e.g. display the "Common Name" in the first X.509 certificate).

PaymentRequest messages larger than 10 MB should be rejected by the wallet
application, to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

===Payment===

Payment messages are sent after the customer has authorized payment:

<pre>
Payment {
  merchantData // string. optional.
  transactions // an array of strings of hex-formatted (and fully-signed and valid) transactions. required.
  refundTo // array of Outputs. required.
  memo // string. optional.
}
</pre>

{|
| merchantData || copied from PaymentDetails.merchantData. Payment hosts may use invoice numbers or any other data they require to match Payments to PaymentRequests. Note that malicious clients may modify the merchantData, so should be authenticated in some way (for example, signed with a payment host-only key). Maximum length is 10000 characters.
|-
| transactions || An array of valid, signed Bitcoin transactions that fully pays the PaymentRequest. The transactions are hex-encoded and must NOT be prefixed with "0x".
|-
| refundTo || One or more outputs where the payment host may return funds, if necessary. The payment host may return funds using these outputs for up to 2 months
after the time of the payment request. After that time has expired, parties must negotiate if returning of funds becomes necessary.
|-
| memo || A plain-text note from the customer to the payment host.
|}
If the customer authorizes payment, then the Bitcoin client:

# Creates and signs a transaction(s) that satisfy (pay in full) PaymentDetails.outputs
# Validate that customer's system unix time (UTC) is still before PaymentDetails.expirationTimestamp. If it is not, the payment should be cancelled.
# A POST a Payment message to the paymentUrl URL. The Payment message is serialized and sent as the body of the POST request.
# The client can optionally broadcast the transaction(s) themselves to the Bitcoin network, but they are not required to do so as the payment host is expected to do so. If the payment host never broadcasts the transaction(s), then after two months the client can recover their funds.

Errors communicating with the paymentUrl server should be communicated to the user.
In the scenario where the payment host's server receives multiple identical Payment
messages for an individual PaymentRequest, it must acknowledge each. The second
and further PaymentACK messages sent from the payment host's server may vary by memo
field to indicate current state of the Payment (for example number of confirmations
seen on the network). This is required in order to ensure that in case of a transport
level failure during transmission, recovery is possible by the Bitcoin client
re-sending the Payment message.

PaymentDetails.paymentUrl should be secure against man-in-the-middle attacks
that might alter Payment.refundTo because the wallet and payment host are using
HTTPS or some other secure transit layer.

Wallet software sending Payment messages via HTTPS must set appropriate
Content-Type and Accept headers, as specified in BIP 271:
<pre>Content-Type: application/bitcoinsv-payment
Accept: application/bitcoinsv-paymentack
</pre>

When the payment host's server receives the Payment message, it must
determine whether or not the transaction satisfies conditions of
payment. If and only if they do, it should broadcast the
transaction to the the Bitcoin p2p network.

Payment messages larger than 10 MB should be rejected by
the payment host's server, to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

===PaymentACK===

PaymentACK is the final message in the payment protocol; it is sent
from the payment host's server to the bitcoin wallet in response to a
Payment message:

<pre>
PaymentACK {
    payment // Payment. required.
    memo // string. optional.
}
</pre>
{|
| payment || Copy of the Payment message that triggered this PaymentACK. Clients may ignore this if they implement another way of associating Payments with PaymentACKs.
|-
| memo || Note that should be displayed to the customer giving the status of the transaction (e.g. "Payment of 1 BTC for eleven tribbles accepted for processing.")
|}

PaymentACK messages larger than 11 MB bytes should be rejected by
the wallet application, to mitigate denial-of-service attacks. This
is larger than the limits on Payment and PaymentRequest messages
as PaymentACK contains a full Payment message within it.

==Localization==

Payment hosts that support multiple languages should generate
language-specific PaymentRequests, and either associate the language
with the request or embed a language tag in the request's
merchantData. They should also generate a language-specific
PaymentACK based on the original request.

For example: A greek-speaking customer browsing the Greek version of a
payment host's website clicks on a "Αγορά τώρα" link, which generates a
PaymentRequest with merchantData set to "lang=el&basketId=11252". The
customer pays, their bitcoin client sends a Payment message, and the
payment host's website responds with PaymentACK.message "σας ευχαριστούμε".

==Certificates==

The original BIP 70 which this spec is based on included signatures from X.509
certificates (the same certificates use for SSL / TLS / HTTPS). We assume the
authentication happens at a separate layer and as such for simplicity we have
removed authentication from BIP 270. Wallets should use other mechanisms to
determine the name and identify of the recipient in a secure manner. Under the
usual case on the web, BIP 270 messages will be sent and received over HTTPS,
which uses X.509 certificates, and thus the wallet should simply show the domain
name under most cases. HTTP (and insecure form of HTTPS) should not be
supported.

==Extensibility==

We use JSON and JSON is naturally extensible. Any property of the objects not
specified in this spec is a candidate to convey information for extensions.

==Notes==

Where message length limits are described in MB, or other units, they should be taken to
be the SI form. Therefore 10MB means 10,000,000 bytes, and not 10MiB which would be 
10,485,760 bytes.

A previous draft of BIP270 required scripts be formatted as a human-readable "isomorphic"
ASM-formatted string, to simplify debugging.  However ASM is a UI concept; it is best left
to user-facing software to decide how display scripts readably rather than enshrining it
in a network protocol.

ASM also has some disadvantages, including:

* it is a more verbose serialization giving larger message sizes
* correct serialization and deserialization is a tricky, arcane process which would raise the chance of implementations differing in corner cases
* not all scripts have a representation as "isomorphic" ASM
* it is ill-defined when BSV moves CScriptNum from 4-byte integers to bignums, because data pushes that can be represented as a CScriptNum are serialized in decimal, and all other data pushes are serialized as hexadecimal.  Digit strings that are valid decimal and hexadecimal are therefore resolved merely on the basis of whether their interpretation as decimal can fit into a CScriptNum
* ASM is ill-defined during any future enablement or transition of OpCodes

By contrast hexadecimal script is easy to implement and unambiguous.
