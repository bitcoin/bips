## Abstract

Payjoin lets Bitcoin senders and receivers interact to make batched
transactions.

This document proposes a backwards-compatible second version of the
Payjoin protocol described in [BIP 78](bip-0078.mediawiki "wikilink"),
allowing complete Payjoin receiver functionality, including payment
output substitution, without requiring a receiver to host a secure
public endpoint. This requirement is replaced with an untrusted
third-party "directory" server accessed via HTTP clients that
communicate using an asynchronous protocol and authenticated, encrypted
payloads. Authenticated encryption depends only on cryptographic
primitives available in Bitcoin Core. Requests use [ Oblivious
HTTP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9458.html "wikilink") (OHTTP) to
prevent the directory and Payjoin peers from linking requests to client
IP addresses.

## Motivation

Satoshi Nakamoto pointed out one specific privacy risk in the white
paper, that transactions with multiple inputs "necessarily reveal that
their inputs were owned by the same owner." Payjoin enables distinct
owners to spend their inputs in a batch, allowing them to combine
independent transfer intents into one transaction. Thus, Payjoin can
address what would come to be called "common-input-ownership heuristic"
by making interactive batching practical.

Beyond addressing Bitcoin's primal privacy risk, Payjoin interactions
can batch more intents into less block weight than the universal
non-interactive batching practice deployed by exchanges to save
transaction fees. One might think of the Payjoin examplar combining a
transfer with a receiver consolidation into one transaction. But Payjoin
can also secure [ transaction
cut-through](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=281848.0 "wikilink"),
allowing a receiver to forward payments further to third parties in the
same transaction a sender funds. For example, deposits to an exchange
may "cut through" the same transaction funding withdrawals. Payjoin
enables more blockspace-efficient transactions to save users fees while
addressing privacy risks.

However, BIP 78's Payjoin version 1 requirements have proven to be an
obstacle to adoption. Version 1 receivers must host a secured
public-facing HTTP server. Mobile and web environments limit the ability
to fulfil such a requirement. Version 1 also requires synchronous
communication. Both sender and receiver must be online simultaneously.
Wallet developers [
regard](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-January/018358.html "wikilink")
these requirements as barriers to Payjoin adoption.

Our goal is to specify a practical coordination mechanism appropriate
for widespread implementation. To this end, the proposal leverages
widespread solutions to common problems, building on web standards and
common Bitcoin primitives.

## Overview

Payjoin senders and receivers interact to construct a transaction. In
version 2 they exchange end-to-end encrypted asynchronous messages using
a store-and-forward directory server, which is accessed using OHTTP. The
*receiver* initiates the protocol by sharing a [Payjoin
URI](#payjoin-uri "wikilink"). The *sender* responds with a fully signed
fallback transaction, known as the *Original PSBT*.

The receiver replies with a *Proposal PSBT* based on the original PSBT.
The sender signs the Proposal PSBT and broadcasts it.

The sender may opt out by ignoring the payjoin information in the
bitcoin URI. Otherwise, at the next step the receiver may opt out by
broadcasting the fallback transaction in the Original PSBT.

### Basic scheme

Before initiating the protocol, the receiver first obtains the
directory's OHTTP configuration (which includes its OHTTP public key).

The receiver initializes a Payjoin Session by generating a secp256k1
keypair. The public key of this keypair is the *receiver key*. The
receiver key enables the sender to establish end-to-end authenticated
encryption using Hybrid Public Key Encryption ([
HPKE](#secp256k1-hybrid-public-key-encryption "wikilink")).

A [ *short ID*](#short-id "wikilink") is derived as a truncated hash of
the receiver key, encoded as uppercase bech32 (without a checksum or
human readable part). The short ID is used to identify a
store-and-forward mailbox on the directory server. A *mailbox endpoint*
is the HTTP resource whose URL has a short ID as its path component. We
refer to any key associated with a mailbox as a *mailbox key*.

As long as a Session is active, the receiver waits for a message from
the sender, by long polling GET requests to the mailbox endpoint hosted
on the server.

This information is included in the [ Payjoin
URI](#payjoin-uri "wikilink") which the receiver shares with the sender
out of band. The `pj=` query parameter contains the mailbox endpoint URL
with additional [ receiver fragment
parameters](#receiver-fragment-parameters "wikilink") that encode the
receiver key and the Payjoin Directory's [ OHTTP Key
Configuration](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/_rfc9458.html#name-key-configuration "wikilink").

The sender constructs an [ HPKE Base
mode](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html#name-encryption-to-a-public-key "wikilink")
payload containing the sender's *reply key*, a PSBT and optional
parameters similar to BIP 78. The resulting ciphertext ensures message
secrecy and integrity when passed to the receiver using the mailbox
endpoint.

The receiver augments the Sender's PSBT with new inputs and outputs, and
may adjust the transaction fee. The receiver then encrypts the resulting
PSBT using [ HPKE Auth
mode](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html#name-authentication-using-an-asy "wikilink")
to the sender's reply key, authenticated using the receiver key. The
receiver then posts this response to a new mailbox whose short ID is
derived from the sender's reply key.

The sender will be long polling the reply mailbox endpoint for a
response from the receiver. Upon receipt, the sender validates the
receiver's Proposal PSBT, and if satisfied, signs its inputs and
broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

Sender and receiver may experience network interruption and proceed with
the protocol since their request and response are buffered in the
directory.

## Specification

### Protocol Sequence

The Payjoin version 2 protocol takes the following steps:

- The receiver generates an ephemeral mailbox key. Its public key is
  known as their *receiver key*.
- Out of band, the receiver shares a bitcoin URI with the sender,
  including a `pj=` query parameter. The `pj` URL path ends with the [
  short ID](#short-id "wikilink"), bech32-encoded (without a checksum or
  HRP) followed by the [ receiver fragment
  parameters](#receiver-fragment-parameters "wikilink").
- The sender generates an ephemeral mailbox key. Its public key is known
  as their *reply key*
- The sender creates a valid version 0 PSBT, the *Original PSBT*,
  satisfying [ the receiver
  checklist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki#receivers-original-psbt-checklist "wikilink").
- The sender's *reply key*, the *Original PSBT*, and optional sender
  parameters, are end-to-end encrypted to the *receiver key* using HPKE,
  and finally encapsulated as OHTTP using the directory's OHTTP key
  configuration. This is [ POSTed](#sender-messaging "wikilink") to the
  directory's OHTTP Gateway. The request is stored in the receiver
  mailbox.
- The sender polls GET requests to the mailbox identified by the
  sender's *reply key* in order to await a response from the directory
  containing a *Proposal PSBT*. It stops polling after expiration.
- Once the receiver is online, it sends `GET` requests [ to the receiver
  mailbox](#receiver-messaging "wikilink") requests to the mailbox. The
  receiver decrypts and authenticates the response, which it checks
  according to [ the receiver
  checklist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki#receivers-original-psbt-checklist "wikilink").
  The receiver updates the *Original PSBT* to include new signed inputs
  and outputs, invalidating sender signatures, and may adjust the
  transaction fee. The result is called the *Proposal PSBT*.
- The *Proposal PSBT* is encrypted to the sender's *reply key*, then
  encapsulated in OHTTP, and POSTed to the sender's mailbox via the
  directory's OHTTP Gateway.
- The directory awaits a GET request from the sender. Upon request, the
  directory relays the encrypted *Proposal PSBT*.
- The sender validates the *Proposal PSBT* according to [the sender
  checklist](#senders-proposal-psbt-checklist "wikilink"), signs its
  inputs and broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

### OHTTP Bootstrapping

Before initiating a Payjoin Session a receiver must first discover the
directory's OHTTP Gateway Key Configuration via an authenticated
bootstrap mechanism before it can initialize a Session to receive
payjoin requests. This mechanism may vary by implementation but must
follow [ OHTTP Consistency
Requirements](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-privacypass-key-consistency-01 "wikilink")
and should not reveal a receiver IP address to the directory. Some
examples of suitable mechanisms include using keys obtained from a
payjoin URI, fetching over a VPN, using keys included with an
application binary, https-in-http CONNECT method, https-in-WebSocket, or
using Tor.

Directories MUST support [ RFC 9540 Key Configuration
Fetching](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9540.html#name-key-configuration-fetching "wikilink")
via GET requests to the directory's OHTTP Gateway. RFC 9540 defines the
gateway location as `/.well-known/ohttp-gateway`.

### Session Initiation

Receivers initiate sessions by sharing a Payjoin URI. Because these URIs
contain sensitive information, such as addresses, they should be shared
over a confidential channel.

#### Payjoin URI

Bitcoin URIs ([ BIP
21](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki "wikilink")
or [ BIP
321](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0321.mediawiki "wikilink"))
are a standard way to request bitcoin.

A Payjoin URI is a Bitcoin URI that contains a `pj` parameter. The `pj`
parameter is a URL in both BIP 78 and BIP 77.

Senders that understand Bitcoin URI but don't support Payjoin will just
ignore the `pj` parameter and proceed to typical address- based
transaction flows.

A `req-pj` parameter, as specified in BIP 21, may be used instead of
`pj` to signal that Payjoin is required.

The `pj` parameter must be [ uppercased and should be the last parameter
of the URI](#uppercase-url "wikilink").

Since version 1 payloads are neither encrypted nor authenticated, and
directory acts as an [ "unsecured payjoin server" in BIP 78
parlance](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki#unsecured-payjoin-server "wikilink"),
backwards compatible receivers MUST enable `pjos=0` to disable output
substitution in order to prevent modification by a malicious directory.

##### Mailbox endpoint

In Payjoin version 2 the URL in the `pj` parameter is the mailbox
endpoint URL. Mailboxes are shared HTTP resources served by the
directory. Clients POST messages to and GET messages from mailbox
endpoints.

###### Short ID

A Short ID identifies a mailbox. The Short ID is the path component of
the mailbox endpoint. They are derived by hashing the compressed
secp256k1 mailbox public key with SHA-256, truncating it to [ 8 bytes
(64 bits)](#64-bit-short-id "wikilink"), and encoding it in
[uppercase](#uppercase-url "wikilink") bech32 with no checksum and with
no HRP (also omitting the '1' separator).

##### Receiver fragment parameters

Payjoin version 2 introduces session-specific parameters which the
receiver shares encoded in the URI.

Instead of defining new Bitcoin URI parameters, the session-specific
parameters are encoded in the [
fragment](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.5 "wikilink")
of the the mailbox endpoint URL.

The `#` fragment separator character must be [ RFC 3986
percent-encoded](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1 "wikilink")

`as `</code>`%23`</code>`, because it is part of the mailbox endpoint URL included in the`

`pj` parameter, not a fragment of the Bitcoin URI.

These session-specific parameters are [
uppercase](#uppercase-url "wikilink") bech32 encoded, with no checksum,
and are separated by a `+` character and prefixed with HRPs according to
their role:

- `RK`: encodes the *receiver key* in compressed form. Senders will
  initiate HPKE with the receiver using this key.
- `OH`: encodes an alternate format of the OHTTP Key Configuration of
  the directory. It consists of a compressed public key of the
  directory's OHTTP Gateway, prefixed by the 2-byte Key Identifier. A [
  RFC 9458 Key
  Configuration](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9458.html#section-3.1 "wikilink")
  is reconstructed by assuming the HPKE KEM ID and Symmetric Algorithms
  are [ fixed](#secp256k1-hybrid-public-key-encryption "wikilink").
- `EX`: specifies a [ session
  expiration](#session-expiration "wikilink") in [ unix
  time](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16 "wikilink").

For example, a properly encoded endpoint URL fragment looks like this
[`bitcoin:tb1q6q6de88mj8qkg0q5lupmpfexwnqjsr4d2gvx2p?amount=0.00666666&pjos=0&pj=HTTPS://PAYJO.IN/TXJCGKTKXLUUZ%23RK1Q0DJS3VVDXWQQTLQ8022QGXSX7ML9PHZ6EDSF6AKEWQG758JPS2EV+OH1QYPM59NK2LXXS4890SUAXXYT25Z2VAPHP0X7YEYCJXGWAG6UG9ZU6NQ+EX1WKV8CEC`](bitcoin:tb1q6q6de88mj8qkg0q5lupmpfexwnqjsr4d2gvx2p?amount=0.00666666&pjos=0&pj=HTTPS://PAYJO.IN/TXJCGKTKXLUUZ%23RK1Q0DJS3VVDXWQQTLQ8022QGXSX7ML9PHZ6EDSF6AKEWQG758JPS2EV+OH1QYPM59NK2LXXS4890SUAXXYT25Z2VAPHP0X7YEYCJXGWAG6UG9ZU6NQ+EX1WKV8CEC)

### Sender Messaging

The sender constructs the fallback transaction, a typical transaction
spending funds to the receiver's address specified in the Payjoin URI.
This transaction is serialized as a PSBT, including UTXO information.

The Original PSBT MUST:

- Include complete UTXO data.
- Be fully signed.
- Exclude unnecessary fields such as global xpubs or keypath
  information.
- Be broadcastable.

The Original PSBT MAY:

- Include outputs unrelated to the sender-receiver transfer for batching
  purposes.

This *Original PSBT* is encoded as base64, followed by the query
parameter string on a new line containing [ optional sender
parameters](#optional-sender-parameters "wikilink").

This plaintext string is encrypted to the receiver key according to
HPKE. The HPKE `info` string, used for domain separation, is `PjV2MsgA`.

    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The resulting HPKE payload is the body of a POST request to the
receiver's mailbox. This request is then [
encapsulated](#client-directory-interactions "wikilink") according to
Oblivious HTTP to the directory's OHTTP Gateway. OHTTP serializes the
inner request as BHTTP, and provides another layer of HPKE encryption,
between the client and directory.

Upon receipt, the directory's OHTTP Gateway decapsulates the OHTTP
request and handles the inner POST request at the receiver's mailbox
endpoint, which stores the HPKE encrypted payload to be forwarded to the
receiver.

The sender then polls OHTTP encapsulated GET requests to the sender's
mailbox endpoint until it receives a response from the directory
containing a *Proposal PSBT*. It stops polling after expiration.

#### Optional sender parameters

When a Payjoin sender POSTs an Original PSBT to the receiver, [ BIP 78's
optional
parameters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki#optional-parameters "wikilink")
are also valid as version 2 parameters.

HPKE binds ciphertexts to application-specific `info` strings. Because
of this domain separation, BIP 78's `v` parameter is redundant and
should be omitted for version 2.

### Receiver Messaging

After sharing the Payjoin URI with the sender, the receiver polls via
OHTTP encapsulated GET requests to the receiver's mailbox endpoint. So
long as the mailbox contains no message, the directory responds with
status 202 ACCEPTED. Once a mailbox contains a message, the directory
return it in the response body with status 200 OK.

Upon receiving an encapsulated 200 OK response, the receiver decrypts
the payload and checks the *Original PSBT* therein according to the
[checklist](#receivers-original-psbt-checklist "wikilink").

The receiver then updates the *Original PSBT* to include new signed
inputs and outputs, invalidating the sender's signatures. The receiver
may also adjust the transaction fee. The result is called the *Proposal
PSBT*.

The Proposal PSBT MUST:

- Include all inputs from the Original PSBT.
- Include all outputs which do not belong to the receiver from the
  Original PSBT.
- Include complete UTXO data.
- Insert additional inputs and outputs at a random index.

The Proposal PSBT sender MAY:

- Add, remove or modify Original PSBT outputs under the control of the
  receiver (i.e. not sender change).

The Proposal PSBT MUST NOT:

- Shuffle the order of inputs or outputs contained in the Original PSBT.
- Decrease the absolute fee of the Original PSBT.

The receiver encrypts the *Proposal PSBT* to the sender's reply key
according to the HPKE protocol. The HPKE `info` string is `PjV2MsgB`.

OHTTP [ encapsulated](#client-directory-interactions "wikilink")
requests from the receivers have the same structure and are thus
indistinguishable from those of the sender.

#### Receiver's Original PSBT checklist

The receiver checklist is the same as the [ the BIP 78 receiver
checklist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki#receivers-original-psbt-checklist "wikilink").

### Sender signing and broadcast

The sender validates the *Proposal PSBT* it receives against a
checklist. If the checks pass, it may sign and broadcast the resulting
payjoin transaction.

#### Sender's Proposal PSBT checklist

The version 2 sender's checklist is the same as the [ the BIP 78 sender
checklist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki#senders-payjoin-proposal-checklist "wikilink").

### Client/Directory interactions

The Payjoin Directory provides a rendezvous point for senders and
receivers to exchange messages. The directory stores Payjoin payloads to
support asynchronous communication. Payjoin version 2 requests must be
submitted as encapsulated messages to the directory's OHTTP Gateway.

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

GET requests on an empty mailbox should block until a message is posted
or a timeout occurs. The timeout should be 30 seconds because that will
not exceed the default timeout for most HTTP clients.

The directory may optionally accept HTTP/1.1 POST requests without OHTTP
to mailbox endpoint URLs for backwards compatibility with Payjoin
version 1 senders.

#### OHTTP Sequence Diagram

### Relay/Directory interactions

RFC 9458 requires each OHTTP Relay to be configured to forward requests
to exactly one OHTTP Gateway. This requirement prevents receivers from
being able to choose any directory, and senders from choosing relays
independently. Without addressing this limitation, senders would have to
know which relays are appropriate to use for each directory, creating a
tendency for one directory and its affiliated relays to monopolize the
Payjoin version 2 protocol.

In order to allow OHTTP Relays to be used with any directory, a
directory's OHTTP Gateway may advertise this allowed purpose. When the
directory receives a GET request to the `/.well-known/ohttp-gateway`
path with an `allowed_purposes` query parameter, its response body
should contain a magic string in the same format as a TLS ALPN protocol
list (a U16BE length encoded list of U8 length encoded strings). The
magic string is `BIP77 454403bb-9f7b-4385-b31f-acd2dae20b7e`, offering
an unambiguous signal to relays that this OHTTP Gateway will accept
requests associated with this purpose from any relay.

By supporting this `allowed_purposes` parameter, the directory signals
to OHTTP Relays that it is willing to handle requests related to BIP 77
Payjoin version 2, removing the RFC 9458's requirement that relays and
Gateways be configured in a one-to-one relationship.

## Rationale

### Uppercase URL

In order to simplify parsing and allow QR encoders to use [ Alphanumeric
QR
mode](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9285.html#name-the-alphabet-used-in-base45 "wikilink"),
which is more compact than Byte mode, the mailbox endpoint URL,
including the fragment parameters, is encoded in uppercase.

Unlike Bitcoin URI parameters, which require switching back to Byte
mode, the use of the URL fragment for session-specific parameters makes
it possible to stay in Alphanumeric mode.

The `pj` parameter mailbox endpoint URL SHOULD be the last Bitcoin URI
parameter to avoid QR mode switching.

### Session Expiration

The directory may hold a message for an offline payjoin peer until that
peer comes online. However, the BIP 78 spec [
recommends](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki#receiver-does-not-need-to-be-a-full-node "wikilink")
broadcasting Original PSBTs in the case of an offline counterparty.
Doing so exposes a naïve, surveillance-vulnerable transaction which
Payjoin intends to avoid.

Because BIP 78 is a synchronous protocol without a standard expiration
mechanism, and automated receivers are vulnerable to probing attacks,
BIP 78 encourages receivers to broadcast the Original PSBT after some
undefined expiration time.

Because BIP 77 is an asynchronous protocol, it requires an explicit [
session-specific fragment
parameter](#receiver-fragment-parameters "wikilink"),`EX`, to
communicate this expiration time to the sender.

There is no way for a sender to prevent a receiver from broadcasting the
fallback transaction extracted from the Original PSBT before the
receiver-specified expiration time.

### 64-bit Short ID Length

64 bits are sufficient to make the probability of experiencing a random
collision negligible. As of writing, the UTXO set has ~2^28 elements.
This is a very loose upper bound for the number of concurrent (non-spam)
sessions, for which the probability of a random collision will be less
than 1%. The actual number of sessions will of course be (orders of
magnitudes) lower given that session are short lived. With ~2^21
sessions (a loose bound on number of transactions that can be confirmed
in 24 hours) the probability is less than 1e-6. These figures bound the
probability of a collision existing anywhere in the entire set, whereas
the probability for an individual session to experience a collision is
\<\< 1e-10 in either case.

### Complete UTXO Data

Complete UTXO data is required because this information is required for
signing some input types.

### HTTP

HTTP is ubiquitous. Using simple HTTP polling allows even Bitcoin Core
to consider an implementation. Unlike a WebSockets protocol, plain HTTP
can benefit from metadata protection by using Oblivious HTTP.

### Oblivious HTTP

OHTTP protects sender and receiver IP addresses both from one another
and from the directory. This makes it more difficult for a directory to
correlate many payjoin transactions with specific IP addresses.

OHTTP relays can be run as basic HTTP proxies from wallet providers or
third parties.

### Uniform Payloads

Encapsulated OHTTP payloads seen by the relay and directory, and
encrypted messages seen by the directory, are constructed to be uniform
so that these third-party services are unable to distinguish between
them.

Encapsulated OHTTP messages are 8192 bytes long, and begin with a
cleartext OHTTP header and an uncompressed key which is distinguishable
from random bytes but uniform across different encapsulated requests.

End-to-end encrypted messages are 7168 bytes long, and should be
indistinguishable from uniformly random bytes. Elligator swift is used
to encode encapsulated HPKE public keys prepended to the HPKE ciphertext
so that the directory can't distinguish between key material, the
ciphertext, and randomness. This ensures the two different protocol
messages are indistinguishable from each other as well as any protocol
extensions.

These padded sizes are sufficient for most PSBTs without exceeding the [
8KB
limit](https://www.geekersdigest.com/max-http-request-header-size-server-comparison/ "wikilink")
of many HTTP/1.1 web servers. 8KB is also too small for image sharing,
making misuse of the directory impractical.

### Secp256k1 Hybrid Public Key Encryption

Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is a modern IETF standard for secure
message exchange without TLS.

Payjoin version 2 uses `DHKEM(Secp256k1, HKDF-SHA256)` and
`ChaCha20Poly1305` AEAD for both OHTTP encapsulation and for end-to-end
encryption between the sender and receiver.

The receiver transmits its receiver key in [ receiver fragment
parameters](#receiver-fragment-parameters "wikilink"). The sender shares
its reply key along with the Original PSBT. These keys are ephemeral and
must only be used for a single Payjoin Session.

#### Secp256k1-based DHKEM

[ Secp256k1-based DHKEM for
HPKE](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-wahby-cfrg-hpke-kem-secp256k1-01.html "wikilink")
is most appropriate because of secp256k1's availability in bitcoin
contexts.

#### ChaCha20Poly1305 AEAD

This authenticated encryption with additional data [
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305 "wikilink")
is standardized in [ RFC
8439](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8439 "wikilink") and has high
performance. ChaCha20Poly1305 AEAD has been implemented [ in Bitcoin
Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15649 "wikilink") for [
BIP 324 Encrypted
Transport](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki "wikilink")
as well. This has widespread support in browsers and common
cryptographic libraries. AES-GCM is more widespread but is both older,
slower, and not typically already a dependency in bitcoin software.

#### HKDF-SHA256

SHA-256 is necessarily available in bitcoin contexts.

## Attack vectors

In addition to the attack vectors and mitigations in [ BIP 78 Payjoin
version
1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078._mediawiki#attack-vectors "wikilink"),
Payjoin version 2 has the following attack vectors.

### Directory Denial of Service

Since each mailbox stores arbitrary encrypted payloads, directories are
vulnerable to flooding. To mitigate such denial of service attacks,
directory operators may respond with `401` unauthorized unless an
authorization token is provided. Authorization tokens must be unlinkable
to preserve client privacy. A specific unlinkable authorization token
mechanism is out of the scope of this proposal.

### Network privacy

Oblivious HTTP must be used to protect the IP addresses of both sender
and receiver from the directory. This requires an OHTTP Key
Configuration to be shared in the Payjoin URI and for the directory to
support Oblivious HTTP.

Unlike BIP 78 implementations, sender and receiver peers will only see
the IP address of the directory and not that of their peers.

Senders which submit requests directly to the directory, without using
an OHTTP Relay, may reveal their IP address to the receiver since that
receiver also specifies the directory.

## Backwards compatibility

Senders not supporting Payjoin will just ignore the `pj` parameter and
proceed to typical address- based transaction flows.

All payjoin versions use [bitcoin URIs](#payjoin-uri "wikilink").
Receivers may choose to accept version 1 payloads at their discretion.

A version 1 sender posts their request to the directory, which stores
and forwards it to the version 2 receiver. A backwards compatible
receiver proceeds with the version 1 checks if the encapsulated response
body is UTF-8 plaintext, signifying version 1. In order to service the
request, a version 1 response must be returned to the sender within 30
seconds or else the directory should respond with an `unavailable` JSON
error code as [ defined in BIP
78](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki#receivers-well-known-errors "wikilink").
