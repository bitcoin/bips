==Abstract==

This BIP proposes reducing the maximum block size from 4MB (weight) / 1MB (base) to a smaller limit in order to mitigate transaction spam, reduce blockchain bloat, and improve node decentralization by lowering the resource requirements for running a full node.

==Copyright==

This BIP is licensed under the CC0 1.0 Universal license.

==Motivation==

Recent increases in Bitcoin blockchain usage, including inscription-based transactions and other data storage use cases, have led to concerns about:

* Blockchain bloat - The blockchain size is growing at an accelerated rate, making it more difficult for new users to sync full nodes
* Resource requirements - Larger blocks require more bandwidth, storage, and processing power, potentially centralizing the network
* Transaction spam - Low-value transactions are filling blocks with non-financial data
* Long-term sustainability - Unchecked growth threatens the ability of average users to validate the chain independently

By reducing the maximum block size, this proposal aims to:

* Limit the rate of blockchain growth
* Reduce barriers to running a full node
* Preserve Bitcoin's decentralization
* Prioritize high-value financial transactions over data storage use cases

==Specification==

===Parameters===

The proposed changes are:

* Reduce maximum block weight from 4,000,000 to 2,000,000 (50% reduction)
* This effectively reduces the maximum base block size from 1MB to 500KB for non-SegWit transactions
* Activation via BIP 9 style miner signaling with 95% threshold
* Minimum activation height: [TO BE DETERMINED]
* Timeout: [TO BE DETERMINED]

===Rationale for Size Selection===

The 50% reduction to 2,000,000 weight units is proposed because:

* It provides meaningful reduction in blockchain growth rate
* Historical analysis shows this capacity would still accommodate typical transaction demand during non-spam periods
* It maintains sufficient capacity for essential financial transactions
* It doubles the effective cost of data storage attacks

===Validation Changes===

After activation at block height N:

* Blocks with weight > 2,000,000 must be rejected
* Miners producing oversized blocks will have them orphaned
* All other consensus rules remain unchanged

==Backwards Compatibility==

This is a hard fork change and requires all participants to upgrade. Nodes that do not upgrade will:

* Reject blocks larger than the new limit (which existing nodes would accept)
* Potentially fork onto a minority chain if economic majority does not follow

The deployment requires:

* Overwhelming economic consensus
* Universal adoption by merchants, exchanges, and service providers
* Clear communication and extended upgrade period
* Coordination with major wallet and infrastructure providers

==Reference Implementation==

A reference implementation will be provided if this proposal gains traction on the Bitcoin development mailing list. The implementation would include:

* Modified block validation logic
* BIP 9 style activation mechanism
* Test cases
* Documentation

==Rationale==

===Design Decisions===

50% Reduction: A significant but not extreme reduction that demonstrates commitment to managing growth while maintaining usability.

Hard Fork Approach: A soft fork cannot reduce limits that are currently valid, requiring a hard fork approach.

===Alternative Approaches Considered===

* Fee Market Solutions: Relying purely on fee markets may not address the fundamental issue of ever-growing resource requirements
* Increased Fees Only: Higher fees alone don't prevent blockchain bloat, just make it more expensive
* Data Pricing Mechanisms: More complex solutions (like separate pricing for witness data) add significant complexity

===Objections and Concerns===

Expected objections include:

* Reduced transaction capacity and higher fees
* Conflict with scaling roadmaps
* Difficulty achieving economic consensus for hard fork
* Potential for fragmenting the network
* May be seen as stepping backward from previous scaling efforts

These concerns must be addressed through community discussion before proceeding.

==Deployment==

Given the controversial nature of this change, deployment would require:

1. Extensive discussion on bitcoin-dev mailing list
2. Rough consensus among developers, economists, and users
3. Support from major economic actors (exchanges, merchants, payment processors)
4. Minimum 12-month notice period before activation
5. Clear communication and education campaign
6. Emergency rollback procedures if adoption is insufficient
