==Abstract==
This BIP aims to provide a more complex cryptography alternative to Bitcoin's traditional encryption scheme. It also specifies a hybrid consensus for allowing both traditional POW and memory hard hashing. The aim is for more optimized cryptographic efficiency and sustainable security in the future.

===BIP Editor and Responsibilities===
The current BIP editor/champion of this proposal '''(the actual author)''' will be responsible for the following:
# Updating the BIP over time
# Advocating for needed updates and changes
# Communicating and commenting on community concerns
# Leading the implementation and development of the proposed BIP

==Specification==
# I do want to implement a NP hardness encryption scheme for complexity. This is not to be confused w/ cryptography for the polynomial reconsructive problem [1]
# I am looking towards integrating memory hard compatibility w/ the hashing algorithm. Memory hard computation allows for time and space complexity for data storage functionality, and there is a way this can likely be implemented without disenfranchising current miners or their hardware if done right.
# I am looking towards more complex ways to tackle invalid blocks or sustainability problems. Most likely this may integrate a lot of custom code but may be an impmentation in regards to this specification. Also see [2]
# The traditional POW style hashing and asymmetric key encryption scheme will still be implemented in this new hard fork.

===Motivation===
The purpose of this proposal is primarily related to Bitcoin's hashing algorithm and cryptography. The idea is centered around an improvement on hashing efficiency and better security. The aim is for mining to be compatible the way that it currently is, as well as memory hard compatibility as well. Besides memory hard or ''proof of space and time'' compatibility, there is another reason that integration needs to be implemented. This includes a cryptographic proof for NP completeness as how to best avoid a significant complexity cracking in the future or a cryptographic attack vector. Nonetheless, Bitcoin's  level of cryptography needs to significantly change in order for Bitcoin to be decentralized and relavant in the future. Significant worries such as Post-Classical Computing i.e Quantum Computing, the solving of the P vs. NP or other threats are posed for Bitcoin's sustainable future. Tackling many of these threats can better be instigated with the cryptographic proofs and systems I believe could be of value.

===Rationale=== 
In regards to cryptographic hashing, an advancement beyond Satoshi's chosen secp256k1 algorithm needs to happen in regards to sustainable security for the near future. This is in part due to the fact that the elliptic curve encryption chosen is very susceptible to break. I believe an asymmetric cryptography algorithm can be better optimized for polynomial time complexity such as an NP hardness encryption scheme possibly based off of Homomorphic encryption, or some sort of regressional model that can be more prominent in the future. 

As stated prior, post-classical computing and potential unsolved mathematical theorems becoming solved, pose a huge threat to breaking Bitcoin's current encryption scheme on many levels. Outside of this implementation, I also believe the hashing algorithm can be modified to allow mining the way it is currently done, as well as be more compatible for memory hard hashing functions. An implementation of a hybrid PoST ''(Proof of Space and Time)'' algorithm and traditional POW ''(Proof of Work)'' is more suited for modern day cryptocurrency mining. While memory-hard hardware might be comparable to the costs of ASIC specific hardware in regards to mining efficiency, this new implementation is more related to expanding the infrastructure available for mining Bitcoin. 

Outside of hardware availability, is also a need for an algorithm to be optimized towards less invalidated blocks. This will be feasible with complex data store functionalities.

==Reference implementation==
Once this started getting some general concensus, I am to publish some preprints further detailing the encryption scheme and math. The same applies to starting the coding and software development as I have the workflow planned out.

===Acknowledgements===
Partial inspiration comes from the [https://www.chia.net/ Chia Network], however this isn't the same thing. The algorithmic capabilities and cryptography scheme in this proposal isn't meant to be a replacement to POW, rather we are giving POW data storage memory-hard compatibility w/ the currently existing hashing compatibilities it has now. We also were somewhat inspired by the halting problem and [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.263.9717 Quantum recursion theory]. There is a huge belief behind this proposal that Bitcoin will radically need to change its cryptography to be relevant in the not so distant future. Regardless of supposed controversy, this is a huge step evidentially needing to be done and even allows for Bitcoin to be further decentralized than what it currently is. I am looking to help create some of these custom cryptographic proofs that may help with that mission.
