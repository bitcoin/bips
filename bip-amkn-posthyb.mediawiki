===BIP Editor and Responsibilities===
The current BIP editor/champion of this proposal '''(the actual author)''' will be responsible for the following:
# Updating the BIP over time
# Advocating for needed updates and changes
# Communicating and commenting on community concerns
# Leading the implementation and development of the proposed BIP

==Specification==
# I do want to implement a NP hardness encryption scheme for complexity. This is not to be confused w/ cryptography for the polynomial reconstructive problem '''[1]'''
# I am looking towards integrating memory hard compatibility w/ the mining algorithm. Memory hard computation allows for time and space complexity for data storage functionality, and there is a way this can likely be implemented without disenfranchising current miners or their hardware if done right.
# In regards to mining, what I am doing isn't the same as the currently existing [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3297280.3297319 Hybrid Mining] process out there, but it is similar.
# The idea involves the implementation of specific [https://iacr.org/cryptodb/data/paper.php?pubkey=29898 memory-hard functions] along with PoW to expand usage to the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ4ea5NNqcg Hard Drive Mining] space. Most likely, this simplest way to do this is a hybrid mining algorithm that computes similarly to PoW, but with some sort of specialized proof. I want to derive a PoW-like algorithm based off of proof of computation, or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing Verifiable computing].
# The computation would likely integrate some sort of probabilistic check-proof scheme, and would need to be adaptable with traditional PoW as well as Proof of Storage. This means at the very least ASIC, CPU, and disk space compatibility.
# I am looking towards more complex ways to tackle invalid blocks or sustainability problems. Most likely this may integrate a lot of custom code, but may be an implementation in regards to this specification. Also see '''[2]'''
# The traditional PoW style mining and an asymmetric key encryption scheme will still be implemented in this new hard fork.
# I found it interesting that there is already an open-source C++ implementation of [https://github.com/sz3/libmcleece Classic McEliece]. Although, most likely we wouldn't be utilizing the Classic McEliece cryptographic proof in this hard fork implementation, this does show that a post-quantum implementation for ''asymmetric key exchange schemes'' is feasible.
# More then likely, the cryptographic implementation created would be a multipath layer randomization cyphertext encryption scheme. It depends on algorithmic complexity, but this encryption scheme is based off of randomization and recomputation in similar ways to the McEliece proof. That scheme also will likley have forms of error encoding.
# Looking into the [https://github.com/taelfrinn/Bip39-diceware bip-39 diceware sheme], and having seen discussions over [https://www.whonix.org/pipermail/whonix-devel/2018-August/001206.html high levels of entropy for diceware], I think the easiest cyphertext randomization method may be a high entropy NP-Complete and qauntum-resistant paraphrase generation method.

====Hybrid Mining====
''This will likely be done through:''
* A PoW/PoST Hybrid
* Not disenfranching current ASIC miners
* Allowing for specific MHFs (Memory-hard functions)
* Integrating a checkable proof centered around verifiable computing

====Regarding Cryptography====
''My preferred method for Cryptography:''
* NP-Complete
* Quantum-resistant
* High entropy ciphertext
* Randomization and recomputation
* Similar to diceware in paraphrasing

===Motivation===
The purpose of this proposal is primarily related to Bitcoin's consensus algorithm and cryptography. The idea is centered around an improvement on mining efficiency and better security. The aim is for mining to be compatible the way that it currently is, as well as memory hard compatibility as well. Besides memory hard or ''proof of space and time'' compatibility, there are other changes that I'm looking towards implementation. This includes a cryptographic proof for NP completeness as how to best avoid a significant complexity cracking in the future or a cryptographic attack vector. 

Nonetheless, Bitcoin's  level of cryptography needs to significantly change in order for Bitcoin to be decentralized and relevant in the future. Significant worries such as Post-Classical Computing i.e Quantum Computing, the solving of the P vs. NP or other threats are posed for Bitcoin's sustainable future. Tackling many of these threats can better be instigated with the cryptographic proofs and systems I believe could be of value.

====Mining Algorithm====
In regards to mining, the new PoW hybrid mining algorithm should allow for mining accessibility across a variety of different hardware. This also won't disenfranchise current miners given that it would still have ASIC compatibility. Currently efficient hash rates are virtually incompatible outside of ASIC devices. This limits the network in terms of speed, and seems to incentivise mining farms instead of everybody else. If a sort of auxiliary PoW algorithm could exist for different hardware architectures, I don't see a reason why somebody with $2m of regular hardware can't mine the same amount of BTC as somebody with $2m worth of ASICs. 

If mining pools could still exhibit similar levels or profitability with an upgraded consensus, it makes no sense why there needs to be a limit to the network growth. In the future, optimization algorithms might also be built into mining pools for block validation and energy efficiency across different infrastructure or for validation techniques. A PoW hybrid opens doors to multiple efficiency routes, as well as energy efficiency routes outside of renewables. This proposal might be a decent first step forward.

===Rationale=== 
In regards to cryptographic key validation, an advancement beyond Satoshi's chosen secp256k1 algorithm needs to happen for sustainable security for the near future. This is in part due to the fact that the elliptic curve encryption chosen is very susceptible to break. I believe an asymmetric cryptography algorithm can be better optimized for polynomial time complexity such as an NP hardness encryption scheme possibly based off of Homomorphic encryption, or some sort of regressional model that can be more prominent in the future.

As stated prior, post-classical computing and potential unsolved mathematical theorems becoming solved, pose a huge threat to breaking Bitcoin's current encryption scheme on many levels. Outside of key validation, is the cryptographic complexity of the hashing algorithm. I believe SHA 256 can be replaced with something such as a NP-Complete Encryption scheme '''[3]''' and potential solutions similar to the McEliece cryptosystem '''[4]'''. This is something I aim to evidently tackle as well. However, I am looking into tackling mining first.

I also believe the PoW algorithm can be modified to allow mining the way it is currently done, as well as be more compatible for memory hard mining functionality. An implementation of a hybrid PoST ''(Proof of Space and Time)'' algorithm and traditional PoW ''(Proof of Work)'' is more suited for modern day cryptocurrency mining. While memory-hard hardware might be comparable to the costs of ASIC specific hardware in regards to mining efficiency, this new implementation is more related to expanding the infrastructure available for mining Bitcoin. 

Outside of hardware availability, is also a need for an algorithm to be optimized towards less invalidated blocks. This will be feasible with complex data store functionalities.

==Backwards compatibility==
This should be backwards compatible with stratum and [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips BIP 40 and 41]. Things such as blind merged mining in [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0301.mediawiki BIP 301], will likely not work. [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki BIP 340] is implemented specifially for secp256k1. In regards to [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0151.mediawiki BIP 151] compatibility, BIP 151 was already withdrawn.

This is a hard fork given the obvious changes in the consensus. Keep in mind that also given the new cryptography method, most likely a new address type would need to be created '''[5]'''. 

Also given the changes to the mining algorithm, it would likely be more optimal for current miners to mine on this new network to reach majority. The same rule of thumb generally applies to most hard forks.

==Reference implementation==
[[File:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mentors4EDU/bip-amkn-posthyb/main/bip-amkn-posthyb/Proposal%20Diagram.png]]
I want to emphasize that I believe greater mining compatibility means a higher level of decentralization. Also, in regards to encryption keys and validation, I believe a higher level of security on that front also means a higher level of decentralization. On the issue of mining, I believe that a hybrid consensus done right wouldn't disenfranchise current miners (as stated prior), and would also still allow people with other hardware to mine BTC. 

I believe a key validation system if done right, could eventually reach NP-completeness. Many promising algorithms have had forms of NP-Completeness in regards to encryption schemes, and coincidentally some of them were also known to be forms of Post-Quantum encryption '''[6]'''. Building an NP-Complete solution can be centered around, yes, it can be solved utilizing deterministic Turing machines, but make the luck chance near impossible forming some form of information-theoretic security in theory.

Once my proposal starts getting some general concensus, I aim to publish some preprints further detailing the encryption scheme and math. The same applies to starting the coding and software development, as I have the workflow planned out.

===Acknowledgements===
Partial inspiration comes from the [https://www.chia.net/ Chia Network], however this isn't the same thing. The mining capabilities in this proposal isn't meant to be a replacement to PoW, rather we are giving PoW data storage memory-hard compatibility w/ the currently existing mining compatibilities it has now. In regards to overall cryptography, we were somewhat inspired by the halting problem and [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.263.9717 Quantum recursion theory]. There is a huge belief behind this proposal that Bitcoin will radically need to change its cryptography to be relevant in the not so distant future. Regardless of supposed controversy, this is a huge step evidentially needing to be done and even allows for Bitcoin to be further decentralized than what it currently is. I am looking to help create some of these custom cryptographic proofs that may help with that mission.
