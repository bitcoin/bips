# One-byte message type allocations

This table lists additional message type IDs that various BIPs have
assigned or proposed for assignment.

Type | Message      | Proposal
---- | ------------ | --------
 n/a | n/a          | (none listed yet)

Note that this table is not authoritative but instead is reflective
of the BIPs proposing the changes. If multiple BIPs make conflicting
assignments for message type IDs, that may lead to multiple entries for
the same message type ID in this table. BIPs that are in Draft status
may be included in the table, and as a result, the IDs and messages they
define may be changed in future.
